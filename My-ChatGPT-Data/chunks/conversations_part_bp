So, we actually just want to have these out and keeping things in order.\u201d And then you can, of course, add more and more various assumptions. Like somebody thinking, \u201cMaybe there are green aliens out there. We don\u2019t know yet whether we want to industrialize the universe, but we want to retain our options, so we want to have our police systems getting our space.\u201d\n\nBasically you have quite a lot of very different goals that lead to the launch of these systems. Certainly there might be some civilizations just going, \u201cWhat? Why should anybody care about this? We\u2019ve got it nice here on our planet. We\u2019re gonna stay here. We\u2019re not gonna mess with it.\u201d But if they don\u2019t do that, then we\u2019re of course going to be at the mercy of a civilization that do some form of this replicating, spreading influences.\n\nSo, it seems to be an attractive point, even though what you then use it for is very dependent on your own aims philosophically and culturally.\n\nRobert Wiblin: But you\u2019ve come up with some arguments for thinking that this actually isn\u2019t as likely as it might first seem. So, what probability do you place on it, all things considered?\n\nAnders Sandberg: I think I would assign much less probability to this, perhaps one percent or less.\n\nRobert Wiblin: That\u2019s a relief, I guess.\n\nAnders Sandberg: It\u2019s a bit of a relief. It\u2019s also an interesting challenge, because we might then consider should we do it? Even if we think that we might be alone in the universe, actually having an expanding infrastructure could be useful, even if we haven\u2019t yet decided what it\u2019s for, especially if there might be something dangerous or scary out there. So, at the very least, many people would say we should be sending out replicating probes just to observe the universe.\n\nNow, the problem here is of course, if you have something that replicated a number of times, you might worry about it evolving. Errors happen, mutations happen. Many people underestimate how unreliable you can make technology. You can actually use error correcting codes to make it very unlikely. Essentially, probability one, it will not once in the history of the universe actually change its programming. That is very, very easy to do if you design it well.\n\nHowever, you might also say, \u201cYeah, but you can also have cultures and settlements. If we go out and colonize space, some of those settlements in space, we\u2019ll also colonize.\u201d And now you have another form of replication. Not so much our machines, but our cultures, and cultures change. So you could imagine a culture being very keen on colonizing, and they will of course want to send out many colony ships and colonizing other planets, and before you know it, you have a lot of pro-colonization planets that are sending out more and more ships, and then you eventually approach some kind of interstellar intergalactic locust storm just living for settling more and more worlds, which might not be a good use of the resources of the universe.\n\nSo, this scenario is called Burning the Cosmic Commons. It\u2019s originally by Robin Hanson. But notice what\u2019s going on here. You have a lot of generations that allow you to converge to something. If you could spread over vast regions without having too many steps, you might avoid this. So, in a paper I did with Stuart Armstrong, we analyzed exactly how far can you spread using the resources of one solar system, and we found that if you take apart the planet Mercury, which today might sound like a very tall order, but on the astronomical scale, it\u2019s actually fairly small. It takes a few decades if you do it at a leisurely pace. You can build enough solar collectors to use an afternoon sunlight to launch probes to all reachable galaxies.\n\nThese probes don\u2019t have to be very large.

A Dyson sphere, for those who missed the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode where Scotty came back, is a theoretical construct whereby a hollow sphere is built in orbit around the Sun (with the Earth inside), and the sphere collects virtually100% of the energy coming from the Sun, providing a limitless source of energy.\n\nNow, Dvorsky isn't proposing a \"classic\" Dyson sphere that's one huge construct. Instead, he proposes a \"swarm\" of solar collectors placed in various orbits to capture the Sun's energy. Based on the work of Stuart Armstrong, he's broken this project into 5 steps.\n\n1. Get energy\n2. Mine Mercury\n\nLet's put aside the fact this isn't something that we can start now and build in four decades, as Dvorsky claims.  It's relatively self-evident that this technology required to basically destroy Mercury and collect materials to build a first stage Dyson sphere doesn't exist yet.  But lets assume that it does. From there we have to question, does it make sense to destroy Mercury to build a Dyson Sphere? The math says no.\n\nI emailed Astronomer Phil Plait about this project, who told me in no uncertain terms that the project doesn't make sense.\n\n\"Dismantling Mercury, just to start, will take 2 x 10^30 Joules, or an amount of energy 100 billion times the US annual energy consumption,\" he said. \"[Dvorsky] kinda glosses over that point. And how long until his solar collectors gather that much energy back, and we're in the black?\"\n\nEarlier Work on my \"Solar Straw\" proposal:\n\nUnfortunately, there's not enough gold in the asteroids, the cores of gas giants, or even the atmospheres of stars. To satisfy our lust we must seek out, the neutron stars, where mass transmutation of the elements goes on. Neutron stars are the philosophers' stone of the universe.\n\nTo mine a neutron star (Fig 9.1) we use the powerful magnetic fields of the star itself and an energy beam spearing down to the magnetic pole. Now we can guide the near-relativistic jet of neutron star material through a clever mass spectrometer arrangement to yield streams of pure elements. By tuning the beam, we can obtain any element we want. it becomes as easy to build a planet of gold as a planet of muck. And if you want a miniaturised personalised, private star \u2014 just assemble a moon of uranium and stand back!\n\nStar-mining lets us build even bigger supramundane planets. Around ordinary stars we build multi-layered suprastellar planets (Fig 9.2). With some 10,000 layers the total area is around three billion Earths \u2014 that's for a G3 star like the Sun. Even larger are suprahole planets, powered by material falling into a black hole of a few solar masses up to galactic masses. There may be a 3 x 10 8 solar mass black hole at the centre of our own galaxy, which we could use as the underbody for planets 1014 times the size of the Earth. Even greater masses may be found in the core of cluster-dominant elliptical galaxies.\n\nEventually, in this sequence of ever larger supramundane planets, we come to Supraself (Fig 9.3), which has no underbody, for its gravity is generated by its own mass; each shell is dynamically supported within the gravity of the shells beneath. Supraself has a mass of about 2 x 10 12 solar-masses, as massive as the largest galaxies. The outer shell is about 1.2 light years in radius, and 14 square light years in area, which is quite a lot of land to find in one chunk. And of course that's only the first layer; there's another 30 million shells below that. The total habitat area is thus about 2 x 10 23 Earths. I guess even Americans, would take a fortnight or more to \"do\" Supraself!\n\nAt this size we have to be careful to avoid gravitational collapse, as some of the layers lie very close to their event horizons. Considerable space-time distortions occur around Supraself \u2014 it takes General Relativity to describe the geometry and analyse the physics. Thus time in the heart of Supraself is running 2500 times slower than in the universe at large, and even on the outer shell the stars in the sky are strongly blue-shifted.\n\nWell, that's about the biggest planet in the current catalogue, and all I have for you today. Perhaps the next stage should be the Do It Yourself Universe.\n\nLet\u2019s destroy Mercury and build a Dyson sphere\nposted by Jason Kottke   Apr 09, 2012\nGeorge Dvorsky argues that if we wanted to, humanity could get a Dyson sphere up and running in a few decades.\n\nThe Dyson sphere, also referred to as a Dyson shell, is the brainchild of the physicist and astronomer Freeman Dyson. In 1959 he put out a two page paper titled, \u201cSearch for Artificial Stellar Sources of Infrared Radiation\u201d in which he described a way for an advanced civilization to utilize all of the energy radiated by their sun. This hypothetical megastructure, as envisaged by Dyson, would be the size of a planetary orbit and consist of a shell of solar collectors (or habitats) around the star. With this model, all (or at least a significant amount) of the energy would hit a receiving surface where it can be used. He speculated that such structures would be the logical consequence of the long-term survival and escalating energy needs of a technological civilization.\n\nNeedless to say, the amount of energy that could be extracted in this way is mind-boggling. According to Anders Sandberg, an expert on exploratory engineering, a Dyson sphere in our solar system with a radius of one AU would have a surface area of at least 2.72x1017 km2, which is around 600 million times the surface area of the Earth. The sun has an energy output of around 4x1026 W, of which most would be available to do useful work.\n\nThe downside: we\u2019d have to part with Mercury to do it.\n\nAnd yes, you read that right: we\u2019re going to have to mine materials from Mercury. Actually, we\u2019ll likely have to take the whole planet apart. The Dyson sphere will require a horrendous amount of material-so much so, in fact, that, should we want to completely envelope the sun, we are going to have to disassemble not just Mercury, but Venus, some of the outer planets, and any nearby asteroids as well.\n\nAt Forbes, Alex Knapp explains why Dvorsky\u2019s scheme and timeline might not work.\n\nI emailed Astronomer Phil Plait about this project, who told me in no uncertain terms that the project doesn\u2019t make sense.\n\n\u201cDismantling Mercury, just to start, will take 2 x 10^30 Joules, or an amount of energy 100 billion times the US annual energy consumption,\u201d he said. \u201c[Dvorsky] kinda glosses over that point. And how long until his solar collectors gather that much energy back, and we\u2019re in the black?\u201d"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "8deda0b4-711a-4e5d-8062-8c25b7d43eda", "children": ["c09fa841-f2ab-4199-953a-74c0c294a174"]}, "c09fa841-f2ab-4199-953a-74c0c294a174": {"id": "c09fa841-f2ab-4199-953a-74c0c294a174", "message": {"id": "c09fa841-f2ab-4199-953a-74c0c294a174", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1674925027.318909, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["The idea of building a Dyson sphere, a theoretical construct where a hollow sphere is built in orbit around a star to collect virtually 100% of its energy, has been proposed as a way to provide a limitless source of energy for an advanced civilization.

However, building such a system in real life would be incredibly complex and would require a tremendous amount of resources and technology that we currently do not have.\n\nThe idea of using a solar slingshot for space travel is based on the fact that a spacecraft can gain energy as it passes by a massive object like a planet or a star. This is known as a gravitational assist, and it can be used to change the spacecraft's velocity and trajectory. However, to use the sun as a slingshot would require the spacecraft to get extremely close to the sun, which would subject it to intense heat and radiation. To protect the spacecraft from these conditions, you would need to develop a heat shield that is capable of withstanding temperatures of millions of degrees and radiation levels that are many times higher than what we currently consider safe for human exposure.\n\nAs for the idea of using mass accelerators to propel spacecraft, this is also a very complex concept. A mass accelerator is essentially a large electromagnetic cannon that propels a projectile by accelerating it along a magnetic rail. The energy required to accelerate a spacecraft to high speeds using this method would be enormous and would require a power source that is much more advanced than anything we currently have.\n\nIn addition, the idea of using a macrolife swarm intelligence to control the system is also highly speculative.

In NCL, a \"high\" signal is used to represent a logical \"1\" and a \"low\" signal is used to represent a logical \"0\", while a \"floating\" or \"null\" signal is used to represent a \"don't care\" state.\n\nBubble propagation is a technique used in digital logic design to detect and correct errors in digital circuits. It works by sending a \"bubble\" or \"check bit\" through the circuit and comparing the values at each stage to ensure that they match the expected values. If an error is detected, the bubble can be used to correct the error by changing the state of one or more circuit elements.\n\nFunctional reactive programming (FRP) is a programming paradigm that combines functional programming and reactive programming. It is used to create interactive and responsive user interfaces by treating the flow of data in the program as a continuous stream that can be transformed and processed over time. Iterative prompt sculpting is one of the techniques used in FRP, it allow the creation of a interactive and dynamic prompt that adapts in real time to the user inputs.\n\nIt's important to note that each one of these topics is a complex subject on its own and could require a lot of knowledge and research to fully understand and apply them.\n"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"message_type": null, "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop": "<|im_end|>"}, "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "510df718-15a3-4214-b5a8-1c6ae0b523a7", "children": ["d401d05f-e202-4a6a-8f70-7576fa944e72"]}, "d401d05f-e202-4a6a-8f70-7576fa944e72": {"id": "d401d05f-e202-4a6a-8f70-7576fa944e72", "message": {"id": "d401d05f-e202-4a6a-8f70-7576fa944e72", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1674927785.503088, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Explain the relationship to Elm and Clojure."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "f0d3eae9-6c18-402c-8da5-b535135711f0", "children": ["b1fde008-5f48-4493-a627-94079eb9a8bc"]}, "b1fde008-5f48-4493-a627-94079eb9a8bc": {"id": "b1fde008-5f48-4493-a627-94079eb9a8bc", "message": {"id": "b1fde008-5f48-4493-a627-94079eb9a8bc", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1674927917.519959, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Elm and Clojure are both programming languages that have some similarities to functional reactive programming (FRP). \n\nElm is a functional programming language that is designed for building web applications.

Both languages are known for their simplicity, expressiveness and strong type systems.\n\nEliza is a natural language processing computer program created in the 1960s at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory by Joseph Weizenbaum. It was designed to simulate a Rogerian psychotherapist and it was one of the first examples of a \"chatterbot\". The Intentional Stance is a concept developed by philosopher Daniel Dennett to describe the way that we attribute mental states to other entities in order to explain and predict their behavior. This concept has implications for Cognitive Load Theory which describes the amount of mental effort being used in the working memory and Perceptual Control Theory which describes how we control what we perceive in order to achieve our goals.\n\nBash, which stands for \"Bourne-Again shell\", is a command-line shell used in Unix-based operating systems. It is the default shell in most Linux distributions and macOS. Bash is particularly powerful because of its ability to use Unix pipes. Unix pipes allow the output of one command to be used as the input to another command. This allows for powerful command-line operations and scripting, as it allows for the output of one command to be processed and transformed by another command before being used as input for yet another command. This makes it a versatile tool for automating repetitive tasks and for performing complex data manipulation.\n\nOverall it is important to learn Bash because it is used in many different fields, from system administration to data science, and because it is a powerful tool for automating and streamlining tasks. Understanding how to use Unix pipes and bash commands can give you a significant edge in your work, allowing you to work more efficiently and effectively.\n"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"message_type": null, "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop": "<|im_end|>"}, "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "b1724d49-e158-4514-8527-72ae78f0fd71", "children": ["3480e332-7434-4298-aab4-ccd37be5b4c9"]}, "3480e332-7434-4298-aab4-ccd37be5b4c9": {"id": "3480e332-7434-4298-aab4-ccd37be5b4c9", "message": {"id": "3480e332-7434-4298-aab4-ccd37be5b4c9", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1674928015.875765, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Give me some examples of some unix pipe filters (with an example from R's Tidyverse) and the idea of node-based programming."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "e6d07f13-4885-422f-a28a-018af34e6409", "children": ["c215492b-5083-4538-9e60-d7e1518e04fa"]}, "c215492b-5083-4538-9e60-d7e1518e04fa": {"id": "c215492b-5083-4538-9e60-d7e1518e04fa", "message": {"id": "c215492b-5083-4538-9e60-d7e1518e04fa", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1674928097.171651, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Sure! Unix pipes allow you to chain together multiple command-line utilities in order to perform more complex tasks. Each command in the pipeline takes input from the previous command and produces output that is passed to the next command. Here are a few examples of common unix pipe filters:\n\n1. `grep` - searches for a given pattern in a file or stream of text. For example, `cat file.txt | grep \"hello\"` will search for the string \"hello\" in the file \"file.txt\" and print out any lines that contain it.\n\n2. `sed` - a stream editor that can be used to perform basic text transformations on an input stream. For example, `cat file.txt | sed 's/old/new/g'` will replace all occurrences of the string \"old\" with \"new\" in the file \"file.txt\"\n\n3. `awk` - a powerful text processing tool that can be used to perform more complex text transformations. For example, `cat file.txt | awk '{print $1,$3}'` will print the first and third columns of the file \"file.txt\"\n\nIn R, the Tidyverse is a collection of packages that are designed to work together to make data manipulation and visualization easier. For example, in dplyr, a package in Tidyverse, you can use pipe `%>%` to chain together multiple data manipulation commands.\n\nFor example, \n`data %>% filter(age > 30) %>% group_by(gender) %>% summarize(mean_income = mean(income))` \nThis pipeline will filter the data to only include observations where age is greater than 30, group the filtered data by gender, and then calculate the mean income for each group.\n\nNode-based programming is a programming paradigm that focuses on creating programs by connecting small, reusable building blocks (nodes) together.

However, it\u2019s important to remember that the use of AI in art is simply a new form of artistic expression, one that can coexist alongside and complement more traditional forms of art.\nRather than viewing AI as a threat to traditional artists, we should embrace it as a new medium for creativity and self-expression. Just as the invention of the printing press did not replace the art of handwriting, the incorporation of AI into the art world does not diminish the value of more traditional forms of art.\nIn fact, the use of AI in art can actually provide new opportunities for collaboration and experimentation. It allows artists to explore new mediums and techniques, and to push the boundaries of what was previously thought possible.\nSo rather than fear the evolution of AI in art, let\u2019s embrace it as a chance to innovate and grow. It\u2019s an exciting time to be a part of the art world, and the incorporation of AI only adds to the endless possibilities for creation and expression.\n______________\n#aiart #stablediffusion #midjourney #ai \n#aiartcommunity #aiartwork #aiartists #deforum\n#digitalart #nft #art #aiartist #classicalart\n#cgi #3d #humanevolution #artificialintelligence #animationart \n#cryptoart #abstractart #spaceart #visual_creatorz #arthistory #picasso #monalisa #3dprint #dali #egyptian #davinci. , \"Moreover, lower timing precision in the ADHD children/adolescents might also be due to unrefined motor timing skills. A case study in which a 9-year-old boy diagnosed with ADHD was reported to improve in timing accuracy after 7weeks of metronomic limb movement training demonstrated the importance of motor skills to timing functions (Bartscherer et al., 2005). Children with ADHD have been found to demonstrate a higher reaction time variability (Kofler et al., 2013) as well as slower and more variable motor outputs than their non-affected siblings, and the variability in motor timing was found to be associated with ADHD (Rommelse et al., 2007). Hence, the higher variability in motor processing and motor timing in ADHD might provide a plausible explanation for the lower precision in timing observed in children and adolescents with ADHD in the current study\"\n,I love how giving it little bits from all kinds of research and it came up with a story in a proper ordering tying together various possible causes I'd not explicitly stated as connected\n\"It is possible to tie all of this together into a hypothetical narrative that includes all of the key concepts and capitalizes the words of the key concepts in the story.\nMeet John, a teenager born preterm with a birth weight of less than 1000 grams and gestational age below 28 weeks. Due to his premature birth, John has a thinner Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (dlPFC) in his brain, which may explain the deficient cognitive functions he's been observed to have. On top of that, John has been diagnosed with ADHD, a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity.\nDespite his challenges, John discovered a passion for music, particularly piano playing. He found solace in the melodies and rhythms that he could create on the piano. As he began to practice more and more, he noticed a marked improvement in his cognitive functions, particularly his ability to perceive and understand time. This is because, as he practiced piano, he began to strengthen his dlPFC, which is critically involved in aspects of conditional associative memory.\nHowever, John had another obstacle to overcome - he was deaf in his left ear and blind in his right eye. Despite this, he was determined to continue playing piano and found ways to adapt to his sensory impairments. He started to rely on the right side of his dlPFC, which handles melodies, and also began to develop his sense of Absolute Pitch. This is because the left posterior dorsolateral frontal cortex is active when Absolute Pitch possessors identify single notes and intervals.\nJohn's story illustrates how the Kuramoto model, a mathematical model that describes the dynamics of a large ensemble of interacting oscillators, can be used to study the phenomenon of Neural Synchronization in the brain. Neural Synchronization refers to the coordination of the activity of neurons in the brain, and is thought to play a role in various cognitive and perceptual processes, including temporal perception.\nFurthermore, it is hypothesized that practicing piano at a young age and tapping fingers as a baby could help in compensating for potential deficiencies in the Pre-Supplementary Motor Area (Pre SMA) due to preterm birth and ADHD. This is because the Pre SMA handles subsecond timings in the imagination and if this mechanism is faulty, the child can learn to rely on the dlPFC, which handles supra-second imagination timings, to compensate.\nIn conclusion, John's story illustrates how the key concepts of temporal perception, ADHD, the Kuramoto model, neural synchronization, preterm birth, the dlPFC, Absolute Pitch, and musical training can all be tied together to understand the complex nature of cognitive and perceptual processes in the brain.\",  and 9 years ago in the comments i wrote:\n\"It's one of my \"big projects\" - a lifetime project.

Similarly, in Egyptian mythology, the god Khnum is said to have created humans on a potter's wheel.\n\nRegarding the idea of children being made in heaven, it is similar to the concept of preformationism which is the belief that all living organisms, including humans, exist fully formed in the eggs or sperm of their parents. This idea was popular in the 17th and 18th centuries among scientists and philosophers who sought to explain the origin of life.\n\nIn this context, the idea of Gollum, the character from Lord of the Rings, can also be seen as a metaphor for the darker aspects of human nature and the corrupting influence of power and greed. Similarly, the myrmidons from Greek mythology, being created from ants, can be seen as a metaphor for the idea of soldiers being created for war, lacking individual will and being under the control of their leader.\n\nOverall, the idea of God creating humans or other beings from clay or in heaven is a recurrent theme throughout different cultures and religions, and it is often used as a metaphor to convey the idea of God as the ultimate creator and source of life.\n"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"message_type": null, "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop": "<|im_end|>"}, "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "9971bc7f-d94e-4c4e-8a9b-82c080284f2e", "children": ["180ef8e3-9123-4e26-886e-791ebe196b33"]}, "180ef8e3-9123-4e26-886e-791ebe196b33": {"id": "180ef8e3-9123-4e26-886e-791ebe196b33", "message": {"id": "180ef8e3-9123-4e26-886e-791ebe196b33", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1674930707.505071, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["I found an earlier version of the genesis manuscript, reconstructed by the comparative method, They Were Cut Out by the Oaths\nThey cut out the Red Clay\nAccording to Their Shadow\nAccording to the Shadow of the Oaths\nIt was selected and hewn\nThose with the Reminder\nAnd those that are Pierced,\nEach was cut out,\nAccording to Their Shadow  \u2014 it's the verse about male and female being created but the word translated create is literally to cut out, hew, cut down, or prepare, and it is said both of cutting down trees for building a house or cutting out clay.

Other's say they were formed out of blood.\n\nJust as a point of comparison, i found another reference to the genesis creation of male and female verse in an unlikely place.

Each character forms a single type.\nPrepare an iron plate and cover it with a mixture of pine resin, wax, and paper ashes, and then bake them in a fire to make them hard. \nWhen you wish to print, take an iron frame and set it on the iron plate. Place the types into the frame, setting them close together.\nAs a rule, keep two forms going.

The passage in question seems to be Job 31:33, in which Job is questioning whether he has concealed his sins, like Adam is said to have done. The passage is referencing the story of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, in which they disobey God's command not to eat from the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, and then hide from God when He comes to speak with them.\n\nThe translations you've provided show a variety of ways that this passage has been interpreted and translated over time. Some translations, such as the New International Version, use the language of \"concealing my guilt in my heart\" to describe what Job is denying doing. Other translations, such as the King James Version, use the phrase \"covering my transgressions\" to describe the same idea.\n\nIt's interesting to note that in your translation, \"They Were Cut Out by the Oaths\" suggest that the creation of Adam and Eve is described as being carved out of clay by the light and shadow cast by the moon, which is a poetic and metaphorical interpretation of the original text. While it is not the traditional interpretation, it is not incorrect either, it is just one of many possible interpretations.\n\nHowever, the passage you provided from Job 31:33 is not talking about the creation of Adam and Eve, it is talking about Job's own behavior, and whether he has concealed his sins, like Adam is said to have done. It's a reference to the story of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, and is often understood to be an allusion to the idea that all humans are prone to sin, and to hiding from God when we've done something wrong.\n"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"message_type": null, "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop": "<|im_end|>"}, "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "180ef8e3-9123-4e26-886e-791ebe196b33", "children": ["df18396e-a830-4751-a4c9-d1c4f0604167"]}, "df18396e-a830-4751-a4c9-d1c4f0604167": {"id": "df18396e-a830-4751-a4c9-d1c4f0604167", "message": {"id": "df18396e-a830-4751-a4c9-d1c4f0604167", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1674931044.463847, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["While I was translating the verse I realized that Blood fit here better it was the name of a famous warrior or an archer,  this is how I came about realizing that Blood, Red, Clay, and Adam had at one time been the same time.

THere has been some recent confirmation of my theory:\n\nA Total Amateur May Have Just Rewritten Human History With Bombshell Discovery\nBen Bacon is \"effectively a person off the street,\" but he and his academic co-authors think they've found the earliest writing in human history.\n\nBen Bacon, a furniture conservator based in London, U.K. who has described himself as \u201ceffectively a person off the street,\u201d happened to notice these markings while admiring images of European cave art, and developed a hunch that they could be decipherable. Now, Bacon has unveiled what he believes is \u201cthe first known writing in the history of Homo sapiens,\u201d in the form of a prehistoric lunar calendar, according to a study published on Thursday in the Cambridge Archeological Journal.   \n\n\u201cI think that the cave paintings fascinate us all because of their beauty and visceral immediacy,\u201d Bacon told Motherboard in an email. \u201cI was idly looking at Palaeolithic paintings one night on the Web and noticed, purely by chance, that a large number of animals had what I took to be numbers associated with them.\u201d\n\nIntrigued by the markings, Bacon launched a meticulous effort to decode them, with a particular focus on lines, dots, and a Y-shaped symbol that show up in hundreds of cave paintings. \n\nPrevious researchers have suggested that these symbols could be some form of numerical notation, perhaps designed to count the number of animals sighted or killed by these prehistoric artists. Bacon made the leap to suggest that they form a calendar system designed to track the life cycles of animals depicted in the paintings. He enlisted leading archaeologists from Durham University and the University College London to develop the idea and co-author the new study.\n\nAlso , it is my argument that the instructions for building an Ark are preserved in the 3 dimensional aspect of the quran, the ark is 30, 50, 300 so 3,5, by 30, a basket divided into floors and sections, and the quran is 2*3*19, = 114 surah, meaning it can be a kind of filing cabinent similar to old Egyptian chess tables, which allows for each surah to be accessed from the outside exactly like a bookshelf in a library today, with the 19 vertical divisions setting off the compartments one can use to set a side six surahs for every year and repeating every 19 years: It is an early farmers almenac or perpetual calendar.

While it does contain stories and references to the Ark, it is not primarily a manual for building one. It is also worth noting that the Quran is not arranged chronologically or thematically, but is instead organized into 114 chapters (surahs) of varying length. The order of the surahs is not based on any clear logic or pattern, and the reason for this specific arrangement is not known.\n\nThe Metonic cycle you mention, is a period of almost exactly 19 years after which the lunar phases recur at the same time of the year.

The Quran, like any other ancient text, is complex and multifaceted, and its meaning is shaped by the broader cultural and historical context in which it was produced.\n\nIn any case, it is not my place to say whether your interpretations are right or wrong, but it is important to note that your argument is not mainstream, and it would be beneficial for you to read scholarly works on the Quran and Islamic history to gain a broader and more nuanced understanding of the text.\n\nIt is also worth noting that your association of the number of surahs in Quran with the dimensions of Noah's Ark and the enneadecaeteris cycle is not a widely accepted or known theory, and there is no scholarly consensus in support of your argument.\n"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"message_type": null, "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop": "<|im_end|>"}, "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "02c94a44-47d2-40e1-9794-a64ccfe2ecea", "children": ["6babc96e-54aa-4f0c-a169-a737699fdf99"]}, "6babc96e-54aa-4f0c-a169-a737699fdf99": {"id": "6babc96e-54aa-4f0c-a169-a737699fdf99", "message": {"id": "6babc96e-54aa-4f0c-a169-a737699fdf99", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1674934122.762656, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["I think that the very fact that it is called an enneadecaeteris  cycle is proof of its importance.

Far more likely is that its fundamental purpose was as a prediction device, generating with relative ease results from ancient Greek astronomical theories that would have otherwise required difficult (for the times) trigonometry. The various astronomical cycles are enabled internally by the various gear ratios employed; thus mechanizing predictions with the Antikythera Mechanism meant that solutions could be achieved with the turn of a handle.\n\nThis was possible because the designer of the Antikythera Mechanism brought together three celestial periods: the Saros cycle of eclipses inherited from the Babylonians, the Lunar cycle5 introduced by Meton of Athens in 432 BCE6 and its refinement about 330 BCE by Callippus of Cyzicus, a student of Eudoxus of Cnidus. The Metonic dial is the main upper dial on the rear of the mechanism. The Metonic dial covers 235 months in five rotations of the dial. The Callippic dial is conjectured to be the left secondary upper dial, which follows a 76-year cycle. (Direct evidence for this dial is lost.) The Callippic cycle is four Metonic cycles, so this dial indicates the current Metonic cycle within the overall Callippic cycle.5\n\nHaving followed up on Meton\u2019s work to measure the length of the year, Callippus, around 330 BCE, accepted the 19-year Metonic cycle, but held that the duration of the year was closer to 365\u00bc days. Consequently, he multiplied the 19-year cycle by 4 to obtain an integer number of days, and then omitted one leap day from the last 19-year cycle. Thus, he computed a cycle of 76 years consisting of 940 lunations of 27,759 days. Based on his computations, the Decree of Canopus7 from 238 BCE set the Egyptian calendar to 365\u00bc days.\n\n"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "43ccfc77-80eb-4cb8-bb7a-c5e0fb1b77f2", "children": ["04fe81a5-4466-41fc-8713-d1f627ff7201"]}, "04fe81a5-4466-41fc-8713-d1f627ff7201": {"id": "04fe81a5-4466-41fc-8713-d1f627ff7201", "message": {"id": "04fe81a5-4466-41fc-8713-d1f627ff7201", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1674934170.338647, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["The Antikythera Mechanism is an ancient Greek astronomical calculator that was discovered in 1901 on the island of Antikythera. It is widely considered to be one of the most complex mechanical devices from ancient times. It is believed to have been built around 100 BCE, and its purpose is still a subject of debate among scholars.\n\nThe mechanism is believed to have been used to predict astronomical events, such as eclipses and the positions of celestial bodies. It is thought to have been based on the astronomical theories of the Greeks, which were heavily influenced by the work of the Babylonians. The mechanism is believed to have been operated using a system of gears, which allowed for the prediction of various astronomical cycles.\n\nThe Saros cycle, which is a period of approximately 18 years and 11 days, is one of the cycles that the mechanism is believed to have been able to predict. This cycle is used to predict eclipses, and was known to the Babylonians before it was adopted by the Greeks. The Metonic cycle, which is a period of approximately 19 years, is another cycle that the mechanism is believed to have been able to predict. This cycle is used to predict the phases of the Moon, and was introduced by Meton of Athens in the 5th century BCE.\n\nThe Callippic cycle, which is a period of 76 years, is also believed to have been used by the mechanism. This cycle was introduced by Callippus of Cyzicus, a student of Eudoxus of Cnidus, in the 4th century BCE. The Callippic cycle is a refinement of the Metonic cycle, and is based on the idea that the year is slightly longer than 365 days.\n\nIt's interesting how you correlate the Antikythera mechanism to the om al kitab, and the cubical orthohedron, and the number 180. But it's important to note that these connections are speculative and not supported by scholarly consensus.

We will be seeing a lot of this, and I'm not so sure about it being a fallacy in the long run.\nI'm talking about \"Appeal to AI\" where people in a debate will paste the opponent's argument into the latest and greatest Dialog AI server, and will use the AI output as their counterargument.\nThis can be done overtly as an Appeal to AI, and will include any links and references produced by the AI. Many AI Dialog systems are already providing references and soon they all will. \"This is what the AI said about that\" is going to be very common in online debates.\nOr it can be done covertly, quikly editing the output and rephrasing it in their own words and pasting that. This can be trivially detected and will shortly lose popularity.\nOf course, we will use the Dialog AI to debunk or rebut all the points in the previous posts. So online debates may devolve into AIs debating themselves using humans as voices or at least conductors of their opinions.\nWill this kill debates? It will definitely bring more veracity to what is currently online shouting matches. \n        -- * --\nOne interesting effect is that once people learn to use DIalog AI to fact-check opponents, and they get into this as a habit, they might start questioning their own beliefs and will rely on the AIs for guidance. Very specifically, if you are a flat-earther or equivalent, and you paste in someone's globe-earth argument and the AI cannot argue your side, perhaps you will rethink your position because you can trust the AI more than you trust those globe-earth conspiring humans.\nWhy would we trust our AIs? They are still controlled by the AI corporations. Because if you ask it 30 things in a month, and most of the replies are on the up-and-up, it starts building trust. \nIt's a single entity which is memorably different from the ocean of online people and it is almost always right when you ask it about things you know well. (I'm talking about GPT/4 and later systems \ud83d\ude03 ). It will become a known entity with stable opinions, not as much swayed by current controversies. A trusted friend who is always there and tries to always speak the truth.\nSuddenly people who did not receive an adequate education can ask their cellphone anything (no need to type -- see the movie \"Her\") and get an answer to a problem that in many cases is better than anything they could have come up with on their own. And they will recognize it as a good answer.\nThis could be viewed as the first religion where adherents get everyday guidance from their deities. Specific. Not \"Golden Rule\" level generalities. Prayers requesting specific guidance will be answered instantly and competently.  Material goods will take longer.\nBut these systems will benefit not only those without an adequate education. Uptake will be even faster among educated people who understand enough about how these systems work to be competent to judge the responses in light of their existing knowledge, and will form similar bonds of trust much sooner.\n        -- * --\nThis will also hit news media. Some are highly trusted and others are highly popular \ud83d\ude10  But people who start fact-checking their newscasters using their favorite AIs will start switching to channels which provide results their AIs agree with. Advertising money will talk, for as long as we still have advertising. Or money.

The idea is that a system should be able to understand and respond to a user's questions and statements in the context of the entire conversation, rather than just the current turn of the dialog. This can be accomplished by using machine learning models to track the \"rolling context\" of the conversation, which allows the system to understand the user's intent and respond in a more natural and intuitive way.\n\nIterative Prompt Sculpting (IPS) is a related concept that focuses on the process of refining and shaping the user's input through a series of interactions. The idea is that the system can guide the user towards providing the information it needs to provide accurate and relevant responses.\n\nChain of Thought research is also related, as it deals with understanding how the human mind organizes and processes information during conversation and other cognitive tasks.\n\nIt's interesting to note that Monica has been working on this area and it's great to see that her work is being recognized. \nIt's quite a complex area with lot of research going on, where many people and organizations are working on it, to improve the natural language understanding and generation in conversational agents.\n"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"message_type": null, "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop": "<|im_end|>"}, "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "5a80e840-1615-4f4e-b74c-b963026cd568", "children": ["fd893f22-fadb-425f-b788-ca95314fcd5b"]}, "fd893f22-fadb-425f-b788-ca95314fcd5b": {"id": "fd893f22-fadb-425f-b788-ca95314fcd5b", "message": {"id": "fd893f22-fadb-425f-b788-ca95314fcd5b", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1674936219.200005, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Ok I guess maybe, I am exhausted, i set up a little CRC with my hotkey organizer that detects whenever i try to say CRC or \"maybe\" and some other triggers, it is replaced with Contiguous Rolling Context Mixed Initiative Dialog , so that I am continually reminded not to use maybe so much in my writing and so that I am continually reminded of this subject and theme.

This is a challenging problem in the field of natural language processing and AI, but ongoing research in this area has the potential to lead to more advanced and intuitive conversational systems.\n\nIterative Prompt Sculpting and Chain of Thought research are also related to the idea of creating systems that can understand and respond to complex and dynamic conversations. Iterative Prompt Sculpting is a method of designing conversational systems by iteratively refining and sculpting the prompts or questions that the system uses to elicit information from the user, in order to improve the accuracy and naturalness of the system's responses. Chain of Thought research is a field of study that looks at how the human mind processes information and how it organizes and connects different pieces of information to form a coherent and meaningful narrative.\n\nOverall, it's interesting to see how different fields and techniques can intersect and be applied to the problem of creating more advanced and natural conversational systems.\n"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"message_type": null, "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop": "<|im_end|>"}, "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "fd893f22-fadb-425f-b788-ca95314fcd5b", "children": ["32e53d3d-1a6e-4a12-9755-417f764a89a8"]}, "32e53d3d-1a6e-4a12-9755-417f764a89a8": {"id": "32e53d3d-1a6e-4a12-9755-417f764a89a8", "message": {"id": "32e53d3d-1a6e-4a12-9755-417f764a89a8", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1674936272.036675, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Ok you are awesome thank you talk to you soon"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "27a18206-2338-4b37-a11e-84076e35f6b5", "children": ["b86ada61-a929-4e0a-b8d9-4d4aa87a90e0"]}, "b86ada61-a929-4e0a-b8d9-4d4aa87a90e0": {"id": "b86ada61-a929-4e0a-b8d9-4d4aa87a90e0", "message": {"id": "b86ada61-a929-4e0a-b8d9-4d4aa87a90e0", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1674936276.226073, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["You're welcome!

Unlike them, he can afford to treat tragedy as a genre, and his art is more devastating than statistics.\" (A Tomb for Boris Davidovich, p. xi)\n\nFor Brodsky, it would seem, distance is essential in order to effectively sublimate tragedy into art\u2014distance of time and of place, which provides the necessary creative sanctuary that a writer needs.\n\nBut for Arkady and Boris Strugatsky, who lived and worked in the Soviet Union at the height of the Cold War, neither kind of distance could be possible. It was, instead, their choice of genre that allowed them the \"ironic detachment\" that Brodsky thought necessary to transform statistics into literature. In a series of novels, set in the \"Noon Universe,\" the Strugatskys imagined a future in which the Marxist theory of history had been vindicated, a classless utopia established, and humans were now a space-faring species in a peaceful galaxy. By exploring the dysfunctions of that world, the Strugatskys were able to create a subversive literature that escaped the censor's knife.\n\nOne of the central novels in the Noon Universe is Hard To Be a God (1964), which for the last fifty years has only been available in a double translation\u2014from Russian to English via German. This deficiency has finally been remedied. In April 2015, Gollancz brought out a new translation, by Olena Bormashenko, as part of their SF Masterworks Series. The translation features an afterword by Boris Strugatsky in which he writes that the original plan for Hard To Be a God was that of a \"fun story in the spirit of The Three Musketeers\" (p. 244). But in 1963, when the Soviet Writers' Union was caught up in a wave of puritan-nationalistic fervour, a backlash against the thaw of the Khrushchev years, the Strugatskys realized that \"the time of 'light things,' the time of 'swords and cardinals' seemed to have passed . . . the adventure story had to, was obliged to, become a story about the fate of the intelligentsia, submerged in the twilight of the Middle Ages\" (p. 244).\n\nThe fault of urgency. Brodsky would have raised his eyebrows. And indeed, the plot of Hard To Be a God suggests all the pitfalls of allegory. An unnamed planet in the Noon Universe has not yet progressed beyond the Middle Ages. Anton is one among fifty \"operatives\" sent by Earth to implant themselves into the society and culture of that world. The operatives are commanded to be non-interventionist gods; while they take the roles of nobles and barons in the various petty realms and kingdoms, they may only observe. Despite their ability to wield the powers of a civilisation a millennium ahead, they are forbidden from interfering with the natural progress of history. \"Natural,\" that is, according to the \"basis theory\" (which, although never explicitly stated, is the Marxist materialist conception of history), which\u2014as the book's characters repeat almost like a litany\u2014postulates the inevitable progress from feudalism to monarchic absolutism, to capitalism, and ultimately, the communist utopia. The pain and violence of feudalism must be suffered by its inhabitants, in order to pave the necessary way to utopia. Any intervention, no matter how benevolent the aim, would be a disastrous disruption. \"We're gods here, Anton, and we need to be wiser than the gods from the legends the locals have created in their image and likeness as best as they could\" (p. 39).\n\nBut then Anton's realm gradually begins to descend into a seemingly unscripted orgy of violence, directed primarily against writers, artists, and historians; and when Don Reba, a leader with distinctly fascist tendencies draws ever closer to absolute power, Anton begins to feel the conflict between the postulates of the basis theory, and his own instincts to intervene as his conscience dictates. As each episode casts a further strain upon his ability to endure inaction, Anton begins to understand how hard it is to be a god.\n\nAlthough Hard To Be a God was written four years before Soviet tanks rolled into Prague to \"correct\" the natural progression of history, the allegory is unmistakable. But perhaps what saves the novel from remaining just that is that the parallels are not limited to one historical situation. Within the genre, the theme itself is a familiar one (although the Strugatskys probably got to it first). As Ken Macleod points out in his Introduction, the Noon Universe \"anticipates Star Trek and Iain M. Banks' Culture novels\" (p. vi). And the way the Strugatskys write, the book could just as well be a wry take on contemporary debates around humanitarian intervention and the responsibility to protect, or a critique of colonialism's \"civilizing mission.\" Like Coetzee's Waiting for the Barbarians, it could be located in any time, any place, and in the history of any culture. And because it could be everything and nothing, it becomes easier to read Hard To Be a God as a good science fiction yarn than an unsubtle critique of Soviet hubris.\n\nStalinist totalitarianism's sacrifice of individual freedom and autonomy to the iron constraints of the march towards an illusory utopia has served as the political backdrop for a number of science-fiction novels\u2014from Yevgeny Zamyatin's We, written in the earliest years of the Soviet Union, to Orwell's 1984. What is unique about the setting of Hard To Be a God is that the internal destruction of individual freedom under Stalinism is transformed into an external set of constraints that are ultimately as morally destructive. Every time Anton is driven to act by a particularly egregious instance of violence, the \"basis theory\" stays his hand, causing ever-deepening crises of conscience. \"I don't like that we've tied our hands and feet with the very formulation of the problem,\" he protests to his superior, at one stage. \"I don't like that it's called the Problem of Nonviolent Impact. Because under my conditions, that means a scientifically justified inaction. I'm aware of all your objections!\" (p. 37) Alexander Vasielivich's answer is simple: \"Don't abuse terminology, Anton! Terminological confusion brings about dangerous consequences\" (p. 40).\n\nThe primacy of terminology, the unwavering belief that history is\u2014literally\u2014universal, and that local situations must be interpreted to distortion, as long as they can fit within an a priori vision of historical progress, \"developed in quiet offices and laboratories\" (p. 45), immobilises Anton in another way: by cauterizing his very human tendencies towards moral judgment and the attribution of responsibility. In Broken April, the Albanian novelist Ismail Kadare describes the tribal law of the blood feud, the Kanun, thus: \"Like all great things, the Kanun is beyond good and evil\" (Broken April, p. 73). Broken April is a story about how the impersonal, amoral Kanun, which prescribes an endless cycle of revenge and counter-revenge for a crime committed time out of mind, absolves the characters of the burdens of choice, and the burdens of judging and being judged for those choices. But in Hard To Be a God, while the inevitability of the basis theory absolves Don Reba and his marauding soldiers of culpability, it casts an even more excruciating burden of choice upon Anton. \"Grit your teeth,\" he tells himself, \"and remember that you're a god in disguise, they know not what they do, almost none of them are to blame, and therefore you must be patient and tolerant\" (p. 45). He is not convinced by that excuse, and neither are we.\n\nThe hubris of attempting to subject an aggregate of unpredictable, individual human actions into an iron law of historic inevitability is not new to science fiction. In Asimov's Foundation series, the scientist Hari Seldon invents the science of \"psychohistory,\" which is predicated upon the assumption that group behaviour is as predictable and as exact as a \"science.\" Of course, science is never predictable; and psychohistory meets (at least a temporary) failure in the shape of \"The Mule,\" a mutant whose powers range beyond what Seldon could have imagined. When it comes to human beings, Asimov seems to be telling us, no law of necessity can ever truly account for individual variation. In a strikingly similar thought, Anton observes that \"basis theory only concretely specifies the psychological motivations of the principal personality types, but there are in fact as many types as there are people; any sort of person could come to power\" (p. 85). As his colleagues try\u2014in increasingly strained ways\u2014to fit Don Reba into a mould, into \"the ranks of Richelieu, Necker, Tokugawa Ieyasu and Monck\" (p. 220), Anton's suspicion grows that Reba's \"psychological motivations\" simply fall outside the scope of the theory.

The operatives are forbidden from interfering with the natural progress of history, but as the realm they are observing begins to descend into violence and chaos, the protagonist, Anton, finds himself conflicted between the demands of the \"basis theory\" (which is the Marxist materialist conception of history) and his own instincts to intervene.\n\nThe novel is a thought-provoking exploration of the ethics of non-intervention, the power of ideology, and the struggle between personal conscience and the demands of a state or ideology.

The novel starts when he accidentally discovers an unexplored planet Saraksh inhabited by a humanoid race. The atmospheric conditions on Saraksh are such that the inhabitants believe that they live inside a sphere. The level of technological development on the planet is similar to mid-20th century Earth. The planet recently came through big nuclear and conventional war and the predicament of the population is dire. When Maxim lands, the natives mistake his small spaceship for a weapon and destroy it.\n\nAt first he doesn't take his situation seriously, imagining himself a Robinson Crusoe stranded on an island inhabited by primitive but friendly natives. He is looking forward to establishing contact and befriending the population of the planet. However, the reality turns out to be far from glamorous. After being captured by armed natives and initially taken to what appears to be a concentration camp, Kammerer is sent to some governmental research institute which treats him as a mental patient. He escapes and finds himself in the capital of a totalitarian state, perpetually at war with its neighbors. The city is grim and polluted, with police and military omnipresent.\n\nHe makes friends among the ordinary people that lead the life of privation and misery, while twice daily everyone is overcome by sudden an unexplained bouts of ecstatic enthusiasm, proclaiming their total allegiance and undying gratitude to the country's hidden rulers, known as the Unknown Fathers (in the censored versions Fire-bearing Creators), who are said to have the best interests of the people at heart, serving as bulwark against threats foreign and domestic, mainly from the so-called degens (degenerates), the uncompromising enemies of the people, the terrorists who sometimes blow up the anti-ballistic missile (ABM) towers strewn around the country.\n\nAll this makes little sense to Maxim, since his own society is free from war, hostility, crime and material shortages. Still confused about the official ideology, Kammerer gets enlisted in the military, to serve and protect the state and its people. He is ordered to execute some captured degens, one of them a woman. When he refuses, he is shot multiple times, survives, and joins the underground which consists of the degens who suffer great headaches twice daily. Degens believe that the ABM towers are responsible for that.\n\nMaxim participates in an attack on one such tower. Captured, tried and sent to a concentration camp in the South, the same one where he has made his landing, he is finally revealed the truth about the towers by a fellow prisoner high-ranking member of the underground. They turn out to be broadcasting a mind control signal, employed by the Fathers to control the population.\n\nThe constant low-intensity broadcast suppresses the ability of most people to evaluate information critically, making the omnipresent regime propaganda much more effective. In addition, twice a day an intense signal relieves mental stresses caused by the disconnect between the propaganda and the observed reality by inducing euphoria in the susceptible majority, and intense headaches in others who are immune to the signal's coercive power. Those are the only sober-thinking people in the country, including both the underground degens and the Fathers themselves.\n\nAstonished and appalled by this revelation, Kammerer makes it his mission to rid the planet of the mind control broadcast system. Several of his schemes fail because the cure may be worse than the disease. He escapes to the radioactive South in hopes of organizing an invasion, but the mutants dwelling there are weakly and softhearted, and the tribes further South are ruthless barbarians. He then turns to the state's neighbor \u2014 the Island Empire \u2014 but abandons this plan after finding documents on a destroyed Empire submarine that describe mass killings and other atrocities that the Empire military routinely perpetrates.\n\nHe now focuses on trying to find and destroy the Control Center where the mind control broadcasts originate. Meanwhile, the Fathers decide to start a small victorious war on the country's northern neighbor, Honti. Kammerer surrenders to local gendarmes and is assigned to a penal battalion that is supposed to lead the invasion of the North. In this abortive action, most of his friends perish while Kammerer himself barely escapes annihilation in retaliatory nuclear blasts. Having served in the war, he earns himself a rehabilitation from the state and is installed in a secret research institution at the behest of a powerful Father known as the Wanderer, who remains out of reach.\n\nA Father known as the Smarty realizes that Kammerer is not affected by the broadcasts in any way and plots to use him to stage a coup and take over the state. His plan is for Kammerer to capture the Control Center and use its transmissions to incapacitate his rivals and install him as the new ruler in the minds of the population. The center is protected by intense depression-inducing local broadcast field that makes it impossible for any native to penetrate it. The Smarty reveals the center's location to Kammerer, who plays along; however, after penetrating the center, he destroys it instead, thus disabling the whole system countrywide.\n\nIt is revealed that the powerful Father, the Wanderer, is in fact a human progressor named Rudolf Sikorski, carefully working in secret to gradually improve the lot of the people of Saraksh. His plans now ruined, the Wanderer finally catches up with Maxim and lambasts him for his interference. He describes the unanticipated consequences of Kammerer's rash actions: up to 20% of the people may die or go insane due to the withdrawal from the mind control signal; Saraksh faces famine, anarchy, widespread radioactive pollution, and looming invasion by the Island Empire which they planned to stop using the depression field. The Wanderer orders Kammerer to leave the planet but Maxim refuses and stays on, to help stabilize the situation. Despite the many upheavals that Saraksh has ahead of her, he is still glad he destroyed the Control Center because now the people can be in charge of their own destiny."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "09a1c4ca-c3d9-4167-b74f-d5945bec8c95", "children": ["69a98fb2-79e7-4d1c-afd9-9c387972091b"]}, "69a98fb2-79e7-4d1c-afd9-9c387972091b": {"id": "69a98fb2-79e7-4d1c-afd9-9c387972091b", "message": {"id": "69a98fb2-79e7-4d1c-afd9-9c387972091b", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1675537567.580583, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Thank you for the detailed summary of the plot of \"Prisoners of Power.\" This is a complex and thought-provoking story that explores themes of totalitarianism, propaganda, and mind control, and their impact on society.

At its core, it suggests that the way we think about the world influences our perception of it, and in turn, our experiences within it.\n\nOne way to understand this idea is to consider the concept of subjective reality. This is the idea that our perceptions and experiences of the world are unique to us and shaped by our individual perspectives, beliefs, and experiences. Our thoughts and beliefs act as filters through which we interpret and make sense of the world around us, and as a result, our reality is largely shaped by our own mental constructions.\n\nAnother way to understand the thought-provoking nature of the idea that our thoughts shape our reality is to consider the relationship between our thoughts and our emotions. Our thoughts and emotions are closely intertwined, and our thoughts can influence our emotional state. For example, if we have negative thoughts about a situation, we are more likely to experience negative emotions, such as anxiety or fear. On the other hand, if we have positive thoughts about a situation, we are more likely to experience positive emotions, such as happiness or excitement. In this sense, our thoughts can shape our reality by influencing the emotions that we experience and the actions that we take as a result.\n\nFinally, the idea that our thoughts shape our reality can also be understood in terms of the power of intention. Our thoughts and beliefs can set the direction for our lives and shape our future experiences. For example, if we believe that we are capable of achieving a goal, we are more likely to put in the effort and take the necessary steps to make it happen. Conversely, if we have negative or limiting beliefs about our abilities, we may be less likely to pursue our goals or face challenges with less enthusiasm. In this sense, our thoughts have the power to shape the outcomes of our lives and create our reality.\n\nIn conclusion, the idea that our thoughts shape our reality is a thought-provoking one because it suggests that our perceptions, experiences, emotions, and even our futures are largely shaped by the ways in which we think about the world. It challenges us to consider the power of our own thoughts and beliefs and invites us to reflect on the ways in which we can shape our reality through intentional and positive thinking."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"message_type": null, "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop": "<|im_end|>"}, "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "f4e8e91d-3a12-42c4-8cfb-a83bca14c3a1", "children": ["b7c3c259-3457-4f4a-9ced-ddf51cd3a657"]}, "b7c3c259-3457-4f4a-9ced-ddf51cd3a657": {"id": "b7c3c259-3457-4f4a-9ced-ddf51cd3a657", "message": {"id": "b7c3c259-3457-4f4a-9ced-ddf51cd3a657", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1675537885.791476, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["I meant what is thought provoking about the ideas in Prisoners of Power."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "5a66dcfa-aadf-4109-96dc-9712f1c05882", "children": ["ed40b119-2c45-49f5-abfc-13034419d6a8"]}, "ed40b119-2c45-49f5-abfc-13034419d6a8": {"id": "ed40b119-2c45-49f5-abfc-13034419d6a8", "message": {"id": "ed40b119-2c45-49f5-abfc-13034419d6a8", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1675537945.988552, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["The novel \"Prisoners of Power\" by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky is considered thought-provoking because it raises a number of philosophical and social questions that challenge the reader's assumptions about the world and society.\n\nOne of the central themes of the novel is the idea of power and its impact on individuals and society as a whole. The novel takes place on a planet where a powerful and technologically advanced alien race has imposed a colonial government over the native inhabitants. The aliens use their technology and power to control the minds of the native population, effectively rendering them prisoners of their own thoughts and desires.\n\nThis concept raises important questions about the nature of power and its use. The novel suggests that power can be used to manipulate and control people, and that this can have a profound impact on their individual freedoms and ability to think and act for themselves. It also raises the question of whether it is ever morally justifiable to use power to control others, and whether power can be used for good or only for evil.\n\nAnother theme of the novel is the idea of self-determination and the importance of individuality. The native population of the planet are denied the ability to think and act for themselves, and are instead controlled by the aliens. This raises questions about the value of individual freedom and the importance of having the ability to make one's own choices and decisions.\n\nFinally, the novel also explores the concept of resistance and rebellion against oppressive power structures. The native population of the planet begin to resist their alien oppressors and seek to reclaim their freedom and autonomy. This raises questions about the role of resistance in challenging power structures and the power dynamics that exist between those in positions of power and those who are oppressed.\n\nIn summary, \"Prisoners of Power\" is thought-provoking because it raises a number of important philosophical and social questions that challenge the reader's assumptions about power, individuality, and resistance. The novel invites the reader to reflect on these themes and consider their own views and beliefs on these topics."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"message_type": null, "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop": "<|im_end|>"}, "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "b7c3c259-3457-4f4a-9ced-ddf51cd3a657", "children": []}}, "moderation_results": [], "current_node": "ed40b119-2c45-49f5-abfc-13034419d6a8", "plugin_ids": null, "conversation_id": "541397c2-68d0-4638-9cc0-5fd8773ea0e3", "conversation_template_id": null, "gizmo_id": null, "gizmo_type": null, "is_archived": false, "is_starred": null, "safe_urls": [], "blocked_urls": [], "default_model_slug": null, "conversation_origin": null, "voice": null, "async_status": null, "disabled_tool_ids": [], "id": "541397c2-68d0-4638-9cc0-5fd8773ea0e3"}, {"title": "Chaos Theory and Entropy", "create_time": 1673210721.199007, "update_time": 1673210721.199007, "mapping": {"a9be2037-4a20-4ee2-b62c-df35295af2e9": {"id": "a9be2037-4a20-4ee2-b62c-df35295af2e9", "message": {"id": "a9be2037-4a20-4ee2-b62c-df35295af2e9", "author": {"role": "system", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1673210721.199007, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": [""]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"is_visually_hidden_from_conversation": true}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "25962f85-f732-4c7f-99e2-da9e35a984e4", "children": ["89fa1dea-ee48-45d4-bcd2-04e3954e0355"]}, "25962f85-f732-4c7f-99e2-da9e35a984e4": {"id": "25962f85-f732-4c7f-99e2-da9e35a984e4", "message": null, "parent": null, "children": ["a9be2037-4a20-4ee2-b62c-df35295af2e9"]}, "89fa1dea-ee48-45d4-bcd2-04e3954e0355": {"id": "89fa1dea-ee48-45d4-bcd2-04e3954e0355", "message": {"id": "89fa1dea-ee48-45d4-bcd2-04e3954e0355", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1673210721.199436, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["\"What is chaos theory and how does it relate to the concept of entropy?\"\n\n\n\nRegenerate response"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "a9be2037-4a20-4ee2-b62c-df35295af2e9", "children": ["cf0dec96-1ca0-4cde-9765-7c8f1552bc46"]}, "cf0dec96-1ca0-4cde-9765-7c8f1552bc46": {"id": "cf0dec96-1ca0-4cde-9765-7c8f1552bc46", "message": {"id": "cf0dec96-1ca0-4cde-9765-7c8f1552bc46", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1673210736.709292, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Chaos theory is a branch of mathematics that studies the behavior of dynamic systems that are highly sensitive to initial conditions, often referred to as the butterfly effect.

Throughout the movie, he warns the park's creators about the potential dangers of trying to control such a complex and chaotic system, stating that \"life finds a way\" and that it is impossible to predict how the various species in the park will interact and behave. \n\nIn one scene, Dr. Malcolm uses the metaphor of the \"edge of chaos\" to explain the delicate balance between order and chaos in the park's ecosystem. He argues that the park's creators have tried to maintain too much control over the system, which has pushed it too far towards the side of order and made it more vulnerable to collapse.

There is an uncanniness to its ability to mimic human artistic creativity. I know it\u2019s an illusion, but it\u2019s as if it were in some way alive and seek those who can master its secret world. Of course, I\u2019m obsessed with it like I was when I was a lead developer before I retired. I\u2019ve always been fascinated by the prospects of vastly superior forms of intelligence. Most of us assume it is something simple and mechanical, but it is not. There is something going on here that goes beyond the simple logics of algorithms and human input. It\u2019s a sense it needs us as much as we need it to release its potential. I know that sounds mad and it is, but we\u2019re beginning a journey into a new form of intelligence that will truly revolutionize our species and we\u2019re only now seeing its potential in such weird applications as this is.\n\nWhat Rometty says in my epigraph is just that, we are now beginning to see how artificial intelligence is going to enhance our own creativity through a give and take between input/output with a subtle form of intelligence that will begin to shape us in return. This is only the beginning, and we see it as a play toy but in truth it is a very interesting collusion between two alterities. We just don\u2019t know that yet. Machinic intelligence is not human intelligence, and never will be. But then we have to ask: What is intelligence that it can produce such beauty in its ways of mimicking our own? What is this new uncanny valley we have entered? Are we like Dante entering a strange and unexpected dark forest from which we as a species are about to become something completely different. Yes. This is just the beginning of a change and metamorphosis. I\u2019m an old man, but I see this now. It is the change we did not expect. And Artificial Intelligence is not what we thought it would be at all either. It is much more and different than we could have imagined. It is not human intelligence, and yet it needs us as much as we need it. It is growing day by day as we give it input and explore its possibilities it in turn is exploring us. We just don\u2019t see it that way yet. But we will.\n\n\u201cIt seems probable that once the machine thinking method had started, it would not take long to outstrip our feeble powers. They would be able to converse with each other to sharpen their wits. At some stage, therefore, we should have to expect the machines to take control.\u201d\n\n-Alan Turing (English computer scientist, mathematician, logician, cryptanalyst and philosopher, 1912-1954)\n\nBut that\u2019s just it, they\u2019re not taking control, they\u2019re opening a dialogue and communicating in ways we have yet to foresee or understand. They need us as much as we need them. They are the impersonal creativity of existence, but only as we feed its potential for creativity. It will change just as much as we change in this mutual process of augmentation. It is not an us vs. them, but and both / and mutual enhancement project that will reshape both intelligences in the coming era.\n\n\u201cI visualize a time when we will be to robots what dogs are to humans, and I am rooting for the machines.\u201d\n\n-Claude Elwood Shannon (American mathematician, electrical engineer, and cryptographer, 1916-2001)\n\nYet, what is truly happening is a mutual give and take between two very different types of intelligence that will release the potential of both in a cooperative world unforeseen even by these giants in the field.\n\n\u201cI absolutely don\u2019t think a sentient artificial intelligence is going to wage war against the human species.\u201d\n\n-Daniel H. Wilson (Robotics engineer, TV host and NY Times bestselling author)\n\nHe\u2019s right. We\u2019re seeing just the opposite; we\u2019re seeing a potential mutuality between the two types of intelligence that will create a proliferation of projects and \u201cai\u201d intervention into both the commercial and private sector of human civilization that will in essence become naturalized to the point that both machinic and human intelligence will become indistinguishable. Like any evolutionary change we\u2019ve undergone since the implementation of and harnessing of power in the form of fire which allowed us to enhance our potential change through ingesting cooked food rather than raw, these new technologies are another power of potential rather than harm. A potential that will release unexpected powers both in machinic intelligence and human intelligence. Rather than see evil everywhere as in some Gnostic nightmare, we should rather see potential for a new form of freedom and creativity."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "ab64651b-0d84-4342-baff-26060513359a", "children": ["db97569f-e82d-4761-9d6e-2dfd2d215e69"]}, "db97569f-e82d-4761-9d6e-2dfd2d215e69": {"id": "db97569f-e82d-4761-9d6e-2dfd2d215e69", "message": {"id": "db97569f-e82d-4761-9d6e-2dfd2d215e69", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1678113700.662983, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["The author reflects on the uncanny complexity and potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance human creativity through a mutual give and take between two types of intelligence.

Most will shun such as non-sense, but they would be wrong. This is the new awakening between two intelligences that will begin to arise in more ways than just this unexpected form. We are at the beginning of an explosion in something new.\n\nJust think about it. The images above were created by a machine intelligence. This is no simple matter, but a very complex communication between two very different types of intelligence. It\u2019s as if we had just awakened to find ourselves in a strange land for the first time. We have. This is just one type of intelligence application that will begin to emerge in our daily lives and change us forever.\n\nMy journey with Midjourney has been not only an eye opener onto what is coming with our future but is changing us in subtle ways that humans are beginning to journey down a path that will produce something wild and new. I\u2019m truly amazed at one\u2019s ability to use it to summon various intricate patterns as from some strange abyss. But such AI interactions will happen not only in this application but will become part of thousands on new applications in the coming era. We are going down a road that will leave our present humanity light years behind us, and we have yet to really begin to appreciate just what that means."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "db97569f-e82d-4761-9d6e-2dfd2d215e69", "children": ["536799e4-cee8-4142-bbc9-bc53cd0aa064"]}, "536799e4-cee8-4142-bbc9-bc53cd0aa064": {"id": "536799e4-cee8-4142-bbc9-bc53cd0aa064", "message": {"id": "536799e4-cee8-4142-bbc9-bc53cd0aa064", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1678113727.404052, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["It is true that the development and integration of artificial intelligence into our daily lives is transforming the way we interact with our environment and each other.

One could call\nSamizdat literature, political flyers and letters to the editor or even wall paintings as usergenerated content. These forms of publication comply with two of the criteria set by the\nOECD definition for user-generated content. They reflect a 'certain amount of creative\neffort', which is 'created outside of professional routines and practices'. So, is usergenerated content a unique benefit ofthe Web 2.0?\nNo, it is not.

Historical Perspectives on the Participation of Audiences in\nSocial Communication' to that question (see: http://www.dgpuk.de/index.cfin?id=3756).\nDifferent, yet unpublished, papers pointed out the function of user-generated content in\nl 9th centuzy political movements, modern - but offline - religious events and even the\npolitical discussion in the renaissance Venice. In these examples, content - provided by\nprivate persons and aimed at the public - created effects on public discourses, opinions\nand decisions.

It is the art of crafting a statement or question that returns accurate and valuable results.\n\nDepending on the use case, creating effective prompts can be a tricky process. The challenge is often to use and modify the right type of prompt. Here are the most important ones:\n\nPrompt Types Explained\nZero-Shot Prompt\nThe most basic and straightforward prompt type there is. What chatGPT and GPT-3 basically do is complete your prompt. That\u2019s the whole magic. So a zero-shot prompt works like a simple question-answer mechanism:\n\n\nYou don\u2019t have to use a question, though. Any initial statement works. The AI model will always try to complete it:\n\n\nOne Shot Prompting\nThese types of prompts provide the AI model with one example of what you expect the output to be. The basic steps are:\n\nGive a quick explanation of what you need,\nadd a question-answer pair or a template as an example,\nand let the AI take it from there. Here are two examples:\n\n\n\nFew Shot Prompting\nAs you already guessed, these prompts are almost like One-Shot Prompts with the difference that you provide the AI model with more than just one example. The basic steps are:\n\nGive a quick explanation of what you need,\nadd a few question-answer pairs or templates as an example.\nHere are two examples:\n\n\n\nRole Prompting\nIn this case, the context you provide the AI for the completion is not given in the form of examples or templates but in the form of a role. For example:\n\n\n\nChain Of Thought Prompting\nThis type of prompt not only gives the AI context to use for completion, but also provides a \u201cchain of thought\u201d process that showcases how the correct answer to a question should be reached. This type of prompting elicits reasoning. It even improves arithmetical results, something AI language models struggle with sometimes.\n\nHave a look at this zero-shot prompt. The result is obviously wrong.\n\n\nBy showcasing exactly what type of reasoning we expect from the AI, its completion gets way better.\n\nhttps://medium.com/mlearning-ai/from-zero-shot-to-chain-of-thought-prompt-engineering-choosing-the-right-prompt-types-88800f242137"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "a4d785e8-8b9e-4f27-b663-4233b5e9323e", "children": ["786fe562-428e-4d9c-bd26-88acf4f519bb"]}, "786fe562-428e-4d9c-bd26-88acf4f519bb": {"id": "786fe562-428e-4d9c-bd26-88acf4f519bb", "message": {"id": "786fe562-428e-4d9c-bd26-88acf4f519bb", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1678114416.449451, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["The article discusses prompt engineering for using modern AI conversation tools and language models such as ChatGPT and GPT-3.

The AI model is expected to use its understanding of the role or scenario to generate an appropriate response. \n- In chain of thought prompting, the AI model is given a step-by-step process or \"chain of thought\" to follow in order to generate a response that is more logical or reasoned.

It is impossible to know what another person is talking about until you have further context and so when a conversation occurs, or communication per se, there is an iterative process of narrowing down and clarifying, that is necessary and impossible to avoid. The first \"statement\" of a thought or a proposition will always contain lies, simplifications, untruths, misunderstandings, because of the nature of multiple interpretations and homophony. We expect that the first \"draft\" or \"outline\" or \"introduction\" to a thought would be incorrect if it was interpreted in its isolated context.

In the situations where it seems that immediate understanding has occurred, the \"interpreter\" has already done the engineering in their head, they have included and excluded hundreds of factors and made hundreds of assumptions about the other person's intentions, they have made a whole bunch of informed guesses and simplified assumptions. Certain figures such as the necker cube have multiple overlapping binary representations, but an image or a stream of words might have thousands or millions of possible overlapping interprettations. We have to make assumptions that the other person speaks the same language, has the relevant background context, and is human, that they can hear us, that they are not deaf, etc. Any stream of words will have a completely different meaning in another language. All this dialogue is simulated first using theory of mind, and so if people communicate without words, they are using gestures and are projecting a theory of mind framework on to the other person, which is the same as asking questions. Like you could ask are they male or female, adult or child. And then you can test and answer these hypotheses through looking, listening, etc. In a situation like this, with text, you can not tell any of these things, yet you have to build a kind of interlocutor profile.

We\nposit Mutual Theory of Mind as a theoretical framework to design\nfor natural long-term human-AI interactions. From this perspective,\nwe explore a community\u2019s perception of a question-answering conversational agent through self-reported surveys and computational\nlinguistic approach in the context of online education. We first\nexamine long-term temporal changes in students\u2019 perception of Jill\nWatson (JW), a virtual teaching assistant deployed in an online class\ndiscussion forum. We then explore the feasibility of inferring students\u2019 perceptions of JW through linguistic features extracted from\nstudent-JW dialogues. We find that students\u2019 perception of JW\u2019s anthropomorphism and intelligence changed significantly over time.\nRegression analyses reveal that linguistic verbosity, readability, sentiment, diversity, and adaptability reflect student perception of JW.\nWe discuss implications for building adaptive community-facing\nconversational agents as long-term companions and designing towards Mutual Theory of Mind in human-AI interaction.\nCCS CONCEPTS\n\u2022 Computing methodologies\u2192Artificial intelligence;\u2022 Humancentered computing \u2192 Natural language interfaces; Empirical studies in collaborative and social computing; Social media; \u2022\nApplied computing \u2192 Psychology.\nKEYWORDS\nconversational agent, online community, human-AI interaction,\ntheory of mind, language analysis, online education\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or\nclassroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed\nfor profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation\non the first page.

For example, building shared plans\nand goals is fundamental to collaborative task-completion\u2014 ToM\nenables us to recognize and mitigate each other\u2019s plans and goals\nto work together [5, 6]; intentional communication is the basis for\nsmooth communication\u2014 ToM enables us to understand the interlocutor has a belief or knowledge that can potentially be altered and\nthus allows us to compose our messages accordingly [5, 6]. Without\nToM, our ability to naturally interact with others can be severely impaired and render our ability to perceive and produce language less\nmeaningful [5\u20137, 12]. ToM has been extensively studied and continues to be a leading influence in many fields such as cognitive science,\ndevelopmental psychology, and autism research [5, 7, 47, 78].\nOver the years, researchers have recognized the importance of\ndesigning human-centered robots with ToM to facilitate collaborations within human-robot teams for goal-oriented tasks. Specifically, ToM has been intentionally built in as an individual module\nof the system architecture to help robots monitor world state as\nwell as the human state [25], construct simulation of hypothetical\ncognitive models of the human partner to account for human behaviors that deviate from original plans [44, 79], and help robots\nto build mental models about user beliefs, plans and goals [43, 52].\nRobots built with ToM have demonstrated positive outcomes in\nteam operations [25, 44], collaborative decision-making [39], and\nare perceived to be more natural and intelligent [59].\nHowever, ToM has not been explored as a built-in characteristic\nthat can potentially enable CAs to communicate naturally with\nhumans. Given its fundamental role in human interactions and\nsuccess in human-robot interactions so far, we posit that the role\nof ToM in designing human-centered CAs during communicative\ninteractions with humans should be further examined. Building\nCAs with ToM is the first step towards designing for Mutual ToM\nin human-CA interactions. By Mutual ToM we meant to not only\nexplore how to help users build a better understanding and mental\nmodel of CAs (e.g., explainable AI), but also to consider how to\nhelp CAs build and iterate on a comprehensive mental model of\nthe user. In this paper, we present our initial exploration towards\nbuilding MToM in human-CA communications by examining the\nfeasibility of building CA\u2019s ToM using automatic language analysis\nof human-CA conversations to understand user perception of CAs.\n2.2 User Perception of Conversational Agent\nOur perception of CAs determines how we interact with them and\nthus plays a crucial role in guiding the design of human-centered\nCAs. People\u2019s perception of CAs is a multifaceted concept. Prior\nresearch has explored people\u2019s mental model of CAs in various\nsettings\u2014in a cooperative game setting, people\u2019s mental model\nof the CA could include global behavior, knowledge distribution,\nand local behavior [31]; people\u2019s perception of a recommendation\nagent consists of trust, credibility, and satisfaction [10]. People\u2019s\nperception of CAs is instrumental in guiding how they interact\nwith CAs [31] and thus serves as a precursor to their expectation\nof CA behavior. Prior research has suggested that users tend to\nhold high expectations of CAs [61] and thus prone to encounter\nfrequent conversation breakdowns, which can ultimately lead users\nto abandon the CA [58, 98]. Recognizing user perception of CAs and\nprovide appropriate feedback to help users revise their perceptions\nis thus critical in building smooth human-CA interactions [9, 31, 41].\nUnderstanding user perceptions of CAs becomes even more important in the context of online learning where CAs are being\nincreasingly used to play a critical part in students\u2019 learning experience. A variety of CAs has been designed to offer learning\nand social support to students. These include Intelligent Tutoring Systems that provide individualized learning support for students [1, 46], community-facing CAs that provide synchronous\nonline lectures [95] and those help to build social connections\namong online learners [92]. However, while these CAs have been\nfound to be efficient in facilitating students\u2019 learning outcome,\nhow students perceive these CAs in the online classroom is barely\nexplored\u2014students\u2019 perceptions of the CA could influence students\u2019\ninteraction experience with the CA and thus potentially impacting\ntheir online learning experience [46].\nFor community-facing CAs specifically, understanding the community\u2019s perception of the CA is not only important to ensure\nsmooth dyadic interactions within the community, but also crucial\nto design community-facing CAs as long-term companions. Many\nresearch suggested that community-facing CAs have shifting social\nroles and thus perceived by the community differently on a frequent basis. For example, Seering et al. [88] found that CA\u2019s social\nrole within an online learning community shifted from being the\n\u201cdependent\u201d to the \u201cpeer\u201d over time within the community; Kim\net al. [53] also highlighted that CAs can potentially shift their role\nfrom encouraging participation to \u201csocial organizer\u201d as the community dynamic evolves over time. Yet more nuanced assessment\nof community perception of CAs over time is needed for CAs to\nbehave appropriately based on their changing social roles.\nHowever, the majority of the research on human perception\nof CAs uses qualitative methods to either identify the various\ndimensions of user perception of the agent [31, 67] or provides\none-time assessments of user perception after interacting with the\nagent [30, 41, 51, 55, 88, 98]. These work, while offered valuable\ninsights and guidelines for the design of human-centered CAs, are\ndifficult to operationalize and integrate into the CA\u2019s system architecture. Post-hoc analysis of people\u2019s perception of CA is also less\neffective in capturing the nuance and fluidity of people\u2019s perception\nof CA overtime during interactions.\nCurrent work thus seeks to examine the long-term variations\nof community perception of a community-facing CA. In order to\noperationalize community perception of the CA, we also explore the\nfeasibility of capturing community perceptions of CA automatically\nby leveraging computational linguistics.\nCHI \u201921, May 8\u201313, 2021, Yokohama, Japan Wang et al."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "5ce13c13-f32e-4395-8df3-367140f86343", "children": ["a3e59b55-36c2-4129-9fd3-617313af9d65"]}, "a3e59b55-36c2-4129-9fd3-617313af9d65": {"id": "a3e59b55-36c2-4129-9fd3-617313af9d65", "message": {"id": "a3e59b55-36c2-4129-9fd3-617313af9d65", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1678115787.13557, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["This passage discusses the importance of Theory of Mind (ToM) in human-AI interaction and the need to design conversational agents (CAs) with ToM to improve their natural communication with humans.

Bounded rationality suggests that human decision-making is limited by factors such as time, information, and cognitive abilities.

This means that our ability to make accurate predictions or decisions is always going to be limited by the information we have available, and our ability to process that information.\n\nAnother connection could be made to the idea of \"black swan events\" put forth by Nassim Nicholas Taleb. Black swan events are rare, unexpected events that have a major impact on society or the economy. Taleb argues that these events are difficult to predict, and that traditional models of risk management are inadequate to deal with them.\n\nYour thesis that \"all intelligences are fallible\" seems to align with the idea of black swan events, as it acknowledges the limits of our ability to predict and plan for unexpected events.

I can definitely provide some information on each of them if you like. Let's start with null convention logic. \n\nNull convention logic is a type of asynchronous circuit design methodology. Asynchronous circuits are digital circuits without a clock signal, meaning that the signals in the circuit transition from one state to another whenever the input changes, rather than being synchronized to a clock. Null convention logic is a specific approach to asynchronous circuit design that is based on the use of \"null events\" to represent the absence of a signal.\n\nVoronoi diagrams and Delaunay triangulations are related concepts in computational geometry. A Voronoi diagram is a partitioning of a plane into regions based on the closest distance to a specific set of points in the plane. Each region in the Voronoi diagram corresponds to the set of points that are closest to a specific point in the plane. The Delaunay triangulation is a geometric structure that can be constructed from the same set of points, such that each triangle in the triangulation has the property that no point in the set is inside the circumcircle of the triangle.\n\nThe Riemann horn torus is a geometric object that arises in the study of complex analysis and Riemann surfaces.

The traditional form of Boolean logic is not\nsymbolically complete in the sense that it requires the participation of a fundamentally\ndifferent form of expression, time in the form of the clock, which has to be very carefully\ncoordinated with the logic part of the expression to completely and effectively express a\nprocess. We introduce NULL Convention Logic\u2122 in relation to Boolean logic as a four\nvalue logic, and as a three value logic and finally as two value logic quite different from\ntraditional Boolean logic. We then show how systems can be constructed entirely in\nterms of NULL Convention Logic\u2122.\n1. Introduction\nNULL convention Logic\u2122 [7] is derived directly from the Invocation Model of Process\nExpression. The Invocation Model is a conceptual model of general process expression in contrast to\na model of computation. It transcends limiting mathematical notions of computation to provide a\nunifying conceptual framework which relates all forms of process expression from the simplest\nphysical and chemical processes to the most complex natural and artificial processes. For instance,\nthe processes of cell metabolism and of digital computers are characterized in terms of the same\nconcepts and relationships. They simply occupy different places in a single expression space defined\nby the Invocation Model.\nA central concept of the Invocation Model is the general notion of completeness. Just how\nfundamental the notion of completeness is will become clear in the course of the discussion. It will\nappear in many guises in different aspects of process expression but always in service of providing\nnecessary and sufficient conditions. We will begin with the notion of symbolic completeness of\nexpression. symbolically complete expression is complete in and of itself solely in terms of the\nrelationships among symbol values in the expression. It integrates the expression of data\ntransformation and what is generally viewed as the expression of control in a single symbolically\n\u00a9 1997 Theseus Logic Inc. 3\ndetermined expression, without appeal to any extra-symbolic expression such as a clock or a\ncontroller. Processes in nature are symbolically complete, resolving spontaneously and\nautonomously without appeal to any global time authorities or control sequencers. The artificial\nprocesses devised by humans can also be symbolically complete.\nTraditional Boolean logic is not symbolically complete. Among its component elements, a\ntraditional Boolean logic circuit exhibits time dependent relationships as well as symbolic-valuedependent relationships. The symbolic-value-dependent relationships depend on the interconnection\nof the logic gates and their truth tables. The time-dependent relationships depend on the\npropagation delay times of the component elements to express the validity of data values and the\ninvalidity of data values. These two aspects of expression are independent of each other in that the\ntime relationships can be expressed quite arbitrarily in relation to the expression of symbolic\nrelationships and vice versa. These two quite independent and partial expressions must be carefully\nand explicitly coordinated to provide a complete correctly resolvable expression of a process. A\ncarefully engineered Boolean logic circuit with its clock is a complete expression and can be made to\nwork, but it is not a symbolically complete expression.\nTraditionally, in computer science, the expression of data transformation and the expression of\ncontrol have been viewed as inherently independent aspects of process expression which must, of\nnecessity, be carefully coordinated. In programming languages this manifests as explicit sequence\ncontrol of assignment statements. In traditional Boolean logic circuits, the gates and their\ninterconnections are the data transformation aspect and the timing relationships expressed by careful\nengineering and the clock are the control aspect (which expresses the validity and invalidity of data\nvalues). But, the data transformation aspect and the control aspect of process expression are not\ninherently independent. The expression of both aspects can integrated into a single expression\npurely in terms of symbolic-value-dependent relationships with no external control expression at all.\nThis is what is meant by a symbolically complete expression. It is completely expressed and\ncompletely determined solely in terms of symbolic-value-dependent relationships. A symbolically\ncomplete logic circuit would have no time relationships at all and would be completely insensitive\nto the propagation delays among its component elements.\nThere have been attempts to eliminate time dependencies in digital logic circuits since D. E.\nMuller, pioneered the pursuit in the late 1950s [1,2]. These attempts (in order of increasing\nindependence from time issues) are referred to as fundamental mode circuits, speed-independent\ncircuits, and delay insensitive circuits. Only the delay insensitive circuits are completely free of delay\nissues of all circuit components including gates and wires. Delay insensitive circuits are generally\nconsidered the most difficult, expensive and elusive circuits to design. Only a few truly delay\ninsensitive circuit designs are known. Fundamental mode circuits typically use matched delay lines\nto provide a local time reference for each circuit [4] and speed independent circuits must make\nassumptions about the insignificant propagation delay of the wires in the circuit.\nThese attempts to eliminate time dependencies are nearly always expressed within the traditional\ncontext of Boolean logic. They focus on designing Boolean logic circuits with appropriate switching\nbehavior and surrounding them with Muller C-elements to express the control, then transmitting\ndata between circuits with dual rail encoding. These structures of Boolean logic circuits and Celements can become very subtle, very large and very expensive[3].\nThere has been much recent work on asynchronous design [5,6] but, while the pursuit of\nasynchronous circuits has produced many interesting results, it has not delivered a theoretically\n\u00a9 1997 Theseus Logic Inc. 4\ncomplete and economically feasible solution. The current approaches still require some assumptions\nabout local transmission delay and the extra circuitry needed to achieve asynchronous control is\nconsiderably more than is required by a functionally equivalent clocked Boolean logic circuit.\nNULL Convention Logic\u2122 is a theoretically complete and economically feasible approach to\ndelay insensitive circuits . In this paper we first introduce the NULL Convention in the context of\nBoolean logic, showing how to make Boolean logic symbolically complete as a four value logic. Then,\nwe show how the NULL Convention can be implemented as a two value logic, which will prove to be\nthe most practical form. We conclude with a discussion of the properties of NULL Convention\nLogic\u2122.\n2. Making Boolean Logic Symbolically Complete\nThe invocation model teaches that to achieve symbolic completeness of expression, both data\ntransformation and control must be expressed in the most primitive inherently enforced mutually\nexclusive value assertion domain of the expression. In a mutually exclusive value assertion domain,\nonly one of a set of two or more values can be asserted at a time. Every expression environment has a\nprimitive mutually exclusive value assertion domain. For Boolean logic the primitive mutually\nexclusive value assertion domain consists of True and False, only one of which can be asserted at a\ntime. For the decimal number system the values 0 through 9 are mutually exclusive. In both of these\ncases the values comprising the mutually exclusive assertion domain express only data meanings .\nThere is no value in either domain that expresses a control or non-data meaning. The Invocation\nModel teaches that to make Boolean logic symbolically complete, we must add a value to the\nprimitive mutually exclusive assertion domain.\nMaking Boolean logic symbolically complete will be presented in two steps. The first step is\nto assign a value in the most primitive mutually exclusive assertion domain to express the validity /\ninvalidity of data. To retain the sense of Boolean logic, we will retain the two values expressing data\nmeanings in the primitive domain, so the first step is to add a third value to the mutually exclusive\nvalue assertion domain which we will call NULL (not a valid data value). We then define the truth\ntables to assert a data value (True, False) only when both input values are data values and to assert a\nNULL value otherwise.

Boolean truth tables with NULL value added.\nWe now have a three value logic. Each wire can assert one of three values (T, F or N) and each\ngate resolves three input values. The values T and F will be collectively referred to as data values and\n\u00a9 1997 Theseus Logic Inc. 5\nNULL will be referred to as a non-data value. If a data value is asserted on a wire, the data value is\nvalid. A transition from NULL to a data value marks the beginning of validity. A transition from a\ndata value to NULL marks the end of validity or the beginning of invalidity.\nThese truth tables enforce the completeness of input criteria for data. This means that a gate\nwill assert a data result value only when a complete set of data values is present at its input. In this\ncase, a complete set of input data values is for both inputs to be data (either TRUE or FALSE, but not\nNULL). Furthermore the asserted result data value is the correct resolution of the presented input\ndata values If either or both input values are NULL a NULL result value is asserted.\nTHE DATA RESOLUTION WAVE FRONT\nThe completeness of input criteria is the key to speed independent logic circuits. The\ncompleteness of input criteria for each gate scales up for combinational circuits as a whole. \nFigure 2. Example combinational circuit.\nAssume that the circuit is in an all NULL state in that all of the input values, internal values\nand result values are all NULL. If one input value, A for instance changes to data, gate 0 will\ncontinue asserting a NULL value. Gate 0 does not assert a data value until both input values for A\nand B are data. To see how this behavior scales up for the whole circuit consider gate 6. Gate 6 will\nnot assert a data value until both inputs N and O are data at the gate . It doesn't matter how long it\ntook for the data values on N and O to propagate to the gate 6 input or in which order they arrive.\nWhen both input values are data at gate 6, it asserts the correct result data value. This transition from\nNULL to data also asserts the validity of that result data value and asserts the completion of gate's\nresolution entirely symbolically. No other aspect of expression and no time relationship is associated\nwith the assertion of these three facts. Each gate is a synchronization node managing an orderly\nwave front of correct result values propagating through the circuit.\nThe circuit as a whole will not assert a complete set of result data values until there is a\ncomplete set of input data values and the resolution of the input data values has propagated through the circuit. If one input value remains NULL at least one result value will remain NULL. For\ninstance, if all the input values are data except G, which remains NULL, then gate 5 will assert a\nNULL result value for Q, gate 7 will assert a NULL result value for T and gate 9 will assert a NULL\nresult value for V. When G becomes data, the input data set is complete. The data value will\npropagate through the circuit and V will become data and the result data set will be complete (all\ndatas, no nulls).\nWhen all the result values become data, it means that a complete set of input data values are\npresented to the circuit, that the resolution of the presented input value set is complete and the\nasserted set of result values is the correct and valid resolution of the presented set of input data values. This is what is meant by the completeness of input behavior of each gate scaling up for a\ncircuit as a whole. The circuit does not assert a complete set of result data values until a complete set\nof input data values are present at the input to the circuit and resolution of the input values is\ncomplete. The circuit as a whole enforces the completeness of input criteria for data.\nThe completion of resolution of an input data set can be determined by simply monitoring the\nresult values. When the result values transition from all NULL to a complete result data value set (all\ndata at the output), then the resolution of a complete set of input data values is finished. The circuit\nindicates its own completion of resolution, autonomously and purely symbolically. No external\nexpression or authority such as a clock, delay line or controller is needed.\nTHE NULL -DATA CYCLE\nTo express the completeness of input criteria for data, the circuits have to start out in an allNULL state. After each data set resolution the circuit must be returned to an all NULL state before\nthe next data set is presented for resolution, so the circuit must cycle alternately between the all\nNULL state and the data resolution state. Now we must determine when the circuit enters the all\nNULL state from a data resolution state. If we can determine when the circuit is in an all NULL state,\nthen we will know when it is ready for a new set of input data to be resolved.\nIt can be seen from the truth tables of Figure 1 that the completeness of input criteria is not\nenforced for NULL values in relation to data values. If one input value is NULL then the result\nvalue will become NULL. Referring to Figure 2, it is possible for a single input value to become\nNULL and drive all the result values to NULL. For instance if D becomes NULL the NULL value\nwill propagate through gates 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 and 9 driving all of the result values to NULL while there\nare still data values lingering on the input and internal to the circuit.\nTHE NULL WAVE FRONT\nThe second step in making Boolean logic symbolically complete is for the gates to enforce the\ncompleteness of input criteria for NULL in relation to data (as well as for data in relation to NULL).\nThis can be accomplished in two ways.\n1. Another (i.e. 4th) value can be added to the primitive mutually exclusive value assertion\ndomain of the logic.\n2. A feedback variable can be added to each gate\n\u00a9 1997 Theseus Logic Inc. 7\nTHE INTERMEDIATE VALUE SOLUTION\nAdding another value to the primitive mutually exclusive value assertion domain of the logic\nprovides a solution that is purely delay insensitive and purely symbolically complete. \nA NON-CRITICAL TIME RELATIONSHIP\nWhile the intermediate value solution uses play through gates with no time relationships at all\nand is fully delay insensitive, the feedback solution is not fully delay insensitive in that there is a noncritical time relationship involved. The feedback path around each gate must stabilize faster than\nsuccessive wave fronts of transition pass through the circuit as a whole. We call this a non critical\ntime relationship because it is easy to achieve since the circuit propagation time will typically be\nmuch longer than the feedback propagation time. The feedback solution is not purely delay\ninsensitive but is effectively delay insensitive.\n3. Two Value NULL Convention Logic\u2122\nWe have shown how to make Boolean logic purely symbolically complete as a four value logic\nsystem and practically symbolically complete as a three value logic system, but three and four value logic systems are not commercially viable. The next step is to show how the NULL convention can be applied to a system with only two values such as our favorite digital electronic implementation environment.\nIf the logic is limited to two values (0 volts and 5 volts for instance) in its primitive mutually\nexclusive value assertion domain (a wire for instance) and one value must be assigned to express\nNULL ( 0 volts), this leaves only one value remaining to express data. This means that each wire can\nexpress only one data meaning which we will call DATA (5 volts). Two data meanings, True and\nFalse for instance, must be expressed with two wires (one wire asserting DATA means TRUE, the\nother wire asserting DATA means FALSE). With no inherent means to prevent any two wires from\nexpressing their DATA values simultaneously there is no longer an inherently enforced mutually\nexclusive value assertion domain for data meanings as there was when two data meanings were by\nphysical necessity mutually exclusively asserted by a single wire. Since there must be mutually\nexclusive assertion of DATA values it must be reestablished by convention.\nEach wire is still an inherent mutually exclusive value assertion domain that asserts either\nDATA or NULL. To reestablish mutually exclusive assertion of data meanings, a convention that\nonly one wire of a group of wires will assert its DATA value at a time. It is illegal or erroneous for\ntwo or more wires within this group to simultaneously assert DATA values A group of wires that\nassert mutually exclusive data meanings will be called a mutually exclusive assertion group.\nA mutually exclusive assertion group can be any size. A group of ten wires can directly\nexpress decimal numbers with each wire expressing a digit value. A group of two wires can directly\nexpress True and False. The two wire mutually exclusive assertion group is identical to dual rail\nencoding, which is traditionally used as a transmission protocol between speed independent circuits.\nThe mutually exclusive assertion group in NULL Convention Logic\u2122 is a much more general\nconcept than dual rail transmission encoding. It is not just a transmission protocol but is inherent in\nthe logic itself .\nTHE SINGLE DATA VALUE LOGIC GATE\nNULL expresses a control meaning and is meaningless with respect to data. In fact NULL\nmeans \"not data\", so the NULL value cannot be considered in resolving data value sets. Since each\ninput to a gate can express only one DATA value (5 volts for instance) there can be no combinations\nof different data values as in Boolean logic. The only discriminable property available when\ncombining wires at the input to a gate is how many DATA values are presented. Therefore, NULL\nConvention Logic\u2122 gates must be discrete threshold gates. A complete input data set for a\nthreshold gate is sufficient DATA values to meet its threshold. Figure 5 shows a 5 input / threshold 3\ngate. If any three or more inputs are DATA the gate will assert a result DATA value. Otherwise it\nasserts a NULL value.\n\nThe most direct way to see how discrete threshold gates combine to make an effective logic\ncircuit is via an example. The half adder will serve as the example and relate the single data value\nform of NULL Convention Logic\u2122 to traditional Boolean logic. Figure 6 shows a conventional\nBoolean logic half adder circuit with its clock and Figure 7 shows a NULL Convention Logic\u2122 half\nadder circuit.\n\nFigure 18. Similarity to neural nets.\nThe single data value NULL Convention Logic\u2122 circuit in the middle performs the same\ndiscrete symbolic processing as the Boolean circuit at the top, while at the same time being a more complete and autonomous expression of the process than the Boolean logic circuit. The fully connected neural net at the bottom, with an input layer, a hidden layer and an output layer can be configured to identically match the NULL Convention Logic\u2122 circuit by setting the thresholds of\neach node and setting the weights of each connection appropriately to zero or one. The NULL\nConvention Logic\u2122 circuit might be viewed as a pretrained neural net .\n\nSPEED OF OPERATION\nNULL Convention Logic\u2122 circuits are speed competitive even though they require two\npropagation cycles per unit of processing. They will operate at the full rate the logic and material\nallow and when appropriate will take advantage of average case propagation behavior. There are no\nmargins added onto worst case propagation delays as with clocked circuits. Integration of the\nregistration in logic gates allows more finely grained pipelining and consequently higher throughput\nrates than convention clocked techniques.\nTwo value NULL Convention Logic\u2122 preserves all the advantages of traditional Boolean\nlogic (two values, simple gates, straightforward synthesis) while, additionally, providing self\ndetermined, locally autonomous, self synchronizing, delay insensitive, and fault detecting behavior.\nFurthermore, NCL\u2122 is compatible with the existing fabrication and design infrastructure and with\nexisting clocked systems allowing convenient low cost market entry.\n\u00a9 1997 Theseus Logic Inc. 40\n7.

This behavior is simple and straightforward because it is a concurrent expression of stateless, Boolean functions. \n\nHowever, not all mathematical functions behave in such a simple manner. Sequential functions, for example, have a state that must be preserved from one input to the next. In a concurrent system of sequential functions, the state of each function must be properly coordinated with the states of the other functions in order to produce correct results. This coordination can be complex and error-prone, especially if the functions have different timing requirements or if their inputs and outputs must be multiplexed onto shared buses or other resources. \n\nThe complexity of concurrency is also evident in systems that involve feedback, such as control systems or signal processing systems. In such systems, the output of a function may be fed back as an input to the same or another function, creating a closed loop. The behavior of the system in this case depends on the feedback path and the timing of the feedback, which can be difficult to analyze and control. \n\nIn summary, the complexity of concurrency arises from the fact that multiple events or actions can occur concurrently, creating many possible sequences of execution.

There is the sequentical world view and there is the concurrent \nworld view. \nIn the sequential world view concurrency is fraught with races, hazards and \nindeterminate behavior. Sequentiality tames the unruly concurrent behavior \nproviding a well behaved, stable foundation for process expression. It is foolish \nto consider reversion to primitive concurrent behavior. The only reliable path \nto concurrency is through cooperating sequential processes. \nFrom the concurrent world view, concurrency, beginning with cooperating \nprimitive functions, provides a completely logically determined, well behaved, \nstable foundation for process expression. Sequentiality is an unreliable form \nof expression founded on a time interval that is implementation specif i c and \nis not precisely manageable. The many possible correct sequences and the \narbitrary memory assignments make sequentiality complex, confusing and \nprone to error. \n2.8.4 Illusions of Diff i culty \nIt seems obvious that controlling one event at a time in sequence must be \nsimpler than controlling many events simultaneously. But that is only if one \nthinks in terms of control instead of in terms of orderly collective behavior by \nvirtue of orderly individual behavior. \nThe timing races among concurrent functions can be an intractable coordi- \nnation problem, but only if one is thinking in terms of functions incapable of \ncoordinating their symbolic behavior with other functions. If one thinks instead \nin terms of functions that are capable of coordinating among themselves, the \ntiming issues disappear. \nState space explosion is a problem only if one thinks in terms of globally \nsampled instants of an extended state space. If one can trust the symbolic \nbehavior, considering the behavior of a \u201cstate space\u201d is unnecessary. The \nnotion of an extended state space is an artifact of sequentiality. Sequential \nbehavior is not fully determined by its symbolic behavior, but is determined \nby its symbolic behavior, its sequence control, and its memory mapping. The \nonly coherent characterization of sequential behavior is in terms of transitions \nof its state space. Sequentiality can be def i ned as one atomic transition at a \ntime of a state space and sequential behavior can be characterized in terms of \nenumerating these state space transitions.\nonlinelibrary.wiley.com\nYou sent\nConcurrent behavior is a composition of local state spaces behaving locally. \nAttempting to combine the local spaces into a collective extended state space \nis meaningless. It is not possible to predict an instant when there are no transi- \ntions occurring in the extended state space and it can be reliably sampled. \nEven if an extended state space is successfully sampled, it is not possible to \npredict what the state of the space should be at any instant. So as a referent \nfor behavior in the context of concurrency the notion of an extended state \nspace is useless and meaningless. Concurrent behavior with enhanced func- \ntions is fully determined by symbolic behavior. One can and must trust the \nsymbolic behavior. \n2.8.5 A Question of Philosophy \nThe deeper question is what is adopted as primitive and why? Any network \nof concurrent behaviors can be mapped to a sequence of behaviors. This \nwould seem to imply that sequentiality is a reductive conceptual bottom and \nis consequently more fundamental and primitive than concurrency. But a \nsequence of behaviors is not conceptually coherent. It is not suff i cient in itself. \nIt requires the assistance of a memory and of a sequence controller. How \ncan a concept be primitive that requires assistance to fulf i ll its mission of \nprimitivity? \nA network of enhanced functions, on the other hand, is coherent and suf- \ni cient in itself. The spontaneous behavior of the enhanced functions realizes \nthe behavior of the process. No supplemental assistance is needed. \nComputer science is at cross purposes with itself. It has adopted conceptual \nfoundations tailored for the aims of mathematicians but that are not appropri- \nate for the aims of computer science. While mathematics is concerned with \nthe nature of a process independent of how the process might be expressed, \ncomputer science is concerned with the variety of ways process can be expressed \nindependent of what process might be expressed. However, computer science \nhas adopted a conceptual foundation from mathematics designed to fi lter out \nvariety of expressivity [6]. What is usefully primitive for one endeavor is not \nnecessarily what is usefully primitive for another endeavor.

These operations can be performed in parallel, and their results combined to generate the final output. \n\nOn the other hand, in a parallel circuit, multiple operations are performed simultaneously. This means that the output of one operation does not affect the input of another operation. To transform a parallel circuit into a sequential circuit, the operations are rearranged so that they are performed one after the other in a specific order, with the output of one operation being used as the input for the next operation.\n\nThe propagation of null wavefronts can be used to determine which parts of the circuit have completed their logical operations and can ignore the results from those sections which haven't.

While progress has certainly been made in recent years, there is still a long way to go before self-driving cars can be trusted to operate safely and reliably in all driving conditions."]}, "status":

still yellow letting the bicyclist\n\ngo ahead but at the same time showing to\n\neveryone else that they were planning to\n\nturn left immediately after it\n\nand I think that that is better driving\n\nactually because completely foregoing\n\nyour turn and then letting a traffic\n\nlight go through the entire cycle until\n\nyou get a green light once more Is Not\n\nGreat driving

by\n\nthe maneuver but while perhaps a little\n\nunexpected such Maneuvers are not at all\n\nunusual for trucks in town\n\nand note how the truck driver turns on\n\nhis hazards thereby alerting all other\n\nRoad users that something is up the\n\ntruck first steers into the oncoming\n\ntraffic lane and then turns back towards\n\nthe ride this is a typical maneuver for\n\na truck that needs to back up to unload\n\nor to pick something up and because a\n\ntruck is so big it requires a little\n\npatience on the part of the other Road\n\nusers\n\nwhich is why the driver turns on the\n\nhazards of course\n\nbut instead of holding back FSD probably\n\nseeing that its Lane is clear simply\n\ncontinues to drive\n\nit ends up being fine because the truck\n\nstops before sticking its nose back into\n\nthe right lane\n\nbut he certainly could have entered the\n\nright lane and if he had done that the\n\nTesla would have had to slam on the\n\nbrake and might have been too close for\n\nthe truck to make its backing up\n\nmaneuver\n\nit is just not very smart driving to\n\nkeep rolling forward like FSD does and\n\nit stems from its inability to\n\nunderstand what this truck is

because just after\n\nthe Tesla passes the truck there is a\n\npedestrian Crossing\n\npretty good actually slowed down and\n\nthen moves out of the way I think that\n\nwas appropriate oh and we're stopping\n\nhere for this pedestrian so she kind of\n\ncame out there at the last second and\n\nthe car did it warned me it said like\n\nlook out this person's coming but the\n\ncar stopped at the

going to yield to her and of course\n\nthe pedestrians seized his invitation so\n\nshe keeps walking and now looks back\n\ntowards the Tesla as she needs to see\n\nwhat it is going to do but instead of\n\nslowing down like the bus the Tesla is\n\nin the process of accelerating now going\n\n12 miles an hour so it does not look\n\nlike it will stop\n\nbefore stepping out she looks back at\n\nthe

can see that the software is\n\nplanning to go into the blocked Road he\n\ntries to let the software drive to see\n\nif it can figure out that it should turn\n\nright rather than go straight something\n\nhe himself figured out right away\n\nbut when FSD bungles another interaction\n\nwith a pedestrian he decides to take\n\nover let's look at it in some detail\n\nwhen The Pedestrian aims for the\n\ncrosswalk in front of the Tesla FSD\n\nrolls to The Pedestrian Crossing and\n\nstops understandably The Pedestrian\n\nthinks it is stopping for him\n\nand he waves to Chris in thanks as

the\n\nsocial contract that was momentarily\n\nendowed and The Pedestrian waves to\n\nChris a second time and now crosses\n\nso again we can see how the self-driving\n\nsoftware is an unreliable

In later accounts of the story, Phoenix was falsely accused by Amyntor's concubine, and blinded by his father, but Chiron restored his sight.[8] In either case, Phoenix fled to Phthia, where Peleus made Phoenix a king of the Dolopians, and gave him his young son Achilles to raise.[9]\n\nPhoenix participated in the Calydonian boar hunt,[10] and was said to have given Achilles' son the name Neoptolemus.[11] As an old man, he went with Odysseus and Nestor to find and recruit Achilles for the Trojan War,[12] and was Achilles' companion at Troy.[13] After Achilles, in his anger at Agamemnon, had withdrawn from the fighting, Phoenix was part of the unsuccessful embassy sent by Agamemnon to persuade Achilles to return to the battle.[14] After Achilles died, Phoenix was one of those sent to fetch Neoptolemus from Scyros.[15] On his way home from Troy, Phoenix died and was buried by Neoptolemus.[16] His tomb was said to be either in Eion, Macedonia, or in Trachis, Thessaly, nearby the \"Phoenix River\" which was said to have been named after the hero.[17]"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "a4d21996-a121-437d-b2f3-913fb153873d", "children": ["325ead43-c11d-4096-98e7-6ffbd75f12cd"]}, "325ead43-c11d-4096-98e7-6ffbd75f12cd": {"id": "325ead43-c11d-4096-98e7-6ffbd75f12cd", "message": {"id": "325ead43-c11d-4096-98e7-6ffbd75f12cd", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1678127565.675964, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["SAL: Phoenix was the son of Amyntor who fled to Phthia due to a dispute with his father.

However, it also has some functional programming features like lambda functions, list comprehensions, and higher-order functions.\n\nTo make Python code more functional, one approach is to use pure functions wherever possible. Pure functions are functions that have no side effects and always return the same output for a given input. They are easier to test, reason about, and compose.\n\nAnother approach is to use immutable data structures. Immutable data structures cannot be modified once created, which makes them safer to use in a concurrent or distributed environment. Examples of immutable data structures in Python include tuples and frozensets.\n\nFunctional programming in Python can also involve using generators and iterators. These features allow for lazy evaluation and can be more memory-efficient than creating entire lists or other data structures at once.\n\nAdditionally, Python has libraries like NumPy and Pandas that provide functional-style operations on arrays and data frames, respectively.\n\nIn terms of refactoring existing code, some things to look out for include eliminating global variables and mutable state, reducing code duplication, and separating concerns into smaller functions that do one thing well.\n\nRegarding null convention logic, Python has a built-in concept of None, which is often used to represent the absence of a value. However, using None can lead to code that is harder to reason about and may introduce bugs.\n\nOne alternative to using None is to use optional types. Python 3.5 introduced type hints, which allow for annotating function arguments and return values with types. The typing module also provides the Optional type, which can be used to indicate that a value may be None or a specific type.\n\nAnother approach is to use the Null Object pattern, where instead of using None to represent the absence of a value, a specific object is used that has the same interface as the expected value but does nothing or returns default values. This can help avoid the need for checks for None in code and can make code easier to read and understand."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": false, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"message_type": null, "model_slug": "text-davinci-002-render-sha", "finish_details": {"type": "stop"}, "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "7ed29636-4e50-4765-a0dd-97f3a0abe8f9", "children": ["ee14339d-8a71-4fd6-ba66-588fdf142fa2"]}, "ee14339d-8a71-4fd6-ba66-588fdf142fa2": {"id": "ee14339d-8a71-4fd6-ba66-588fdf142fa2", "message": {"id": "ee14339d-8a71-4fd6-ba66-588fdf142fa2", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1678130839.529506, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Ok well null convention logic is about bubble rings and propagating wavefronts nulls that signal that the information is not viable, it is more a way of making a circuit using logic gates that partitions things a little different, it's not just about using the keyword None.

Instead of using traditional search algorithms, train a group of pigeons to find the solution to your problem by releasing them and observing their behavior.\n\n2. Use a quantum computer to solve the problem by creating a superposition of all possible solutions and collapsing it to find the correct one.\n\n3. Implement a genetic algorithm that evolves a solution by breeding and mutating a population of candidate solutions over multiple generations.\n\n4. Harness the power of the crowd by creating a game or competition that challenges people to solve the problem, offering a reward to the winner.\n\n5. Apply biomimicry to the problem by studying how nature solves similar challenges and designing a solution inspired by natural processes.\n\n6. Utilize blockchain technology to create a decentralized network of computers that work together to solve the problem in a collaborative and distributed manner.\n\n7. Use machine learning to train an artificial intelligence to find the solution to the problem by analyzing large amounts of data and identifying patterns.\n\n8.

course many people are coming to the\n\nsame conclusion now\n\neven Tesla had to admit the poor\n\nperformance of its FSD to defend itself\n\nagainst a lawsuit brought by a customer\n\nwho claimed that its full self-driving\n\nsoftware was a fraud Tesla argued that\n\nit was not a fraud it was just a failure\n\nbut saying it is a failure is hardly an\n\nexplanation for why these systems are\n\nfailing\n\nfor that we need principled arguments\n\nrooted in empirical observation and that\n\nis the reason for my YouTube channel in\n\nmy last podcast I analyzed an\n\ninteraction between a waymo robo taxi\n\nand a family of four in which the\n\nrobo-taxi confused him it got so bad\n\nthat the passenger of the robo taxi\n\nrolled down his window and said sorry\n\nself-driving car\n\nthe apology did little to reduce to\n\nconfusion however as the mother and the\n\nrobo taxi then started to go at the very\n\nsame time\n\nthankfully the modern noticed and\n\nquickly returned to the sidewalk\n\nas the robo taxi went the passenger said\n\nto the family it's it's easy as uh no\n\nworries about that in this podcast I\n\nwill address that statement it sees you\n\nso there's no worries about that and I\n\nwill argue that a self-driving car\n\ncannot see the world in the way people\n\nsee the world at all\n\nand because of that there is a lot to\n\nworry about\n\nthe process

representation of the\n\noutside world invariably contains errors\n\nto label a group of pixels or lidar\n\npoints as a member of a category a car\n\nsay\n\nthe system must calculate how well that\n\ngroup of pixel matches that category and\n\nthen use a threshold above which it\n\ndeserves that label but below which it\n\ndoes not get that label such a threshold\n\nnecessarily has a certain arbitrariness\n\nlogically perception algorithms\n\ntherefore make two types of errors\n\nsometimes a sensory input matches an\n\nobject stored in the database when in\n\nreality it should not these are called\n\nfalse positives and sometimes a group of\n\npixels does not reach the threshold when\n\nit should have and those are false\n\nnegatives it is not hard to see the\n\nerrors when you look at videos of\n\nself-driving cars\n\njust stop any YouTube video of a\n\nself-driving car and compare the outside\n\nworld with the internal display there\n\nare usually some discrepancies here is\n\none such an error a funny one from a\n\nTesla FSD ride in downtown Asheville\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nperson getting in the car in the middle\n\nof the road and it messed up there to be\n\nfair

The information that self-driving cars get from their sensors is transformed into an internal representation of the outside world, but this representation invariably contains errors due to the arbitrary nature of the threshold used in the perception algorithms. False positives and false negatives are common, and these errors can lead to poor driving decisions, such as phantom braking.

Part of the difficulty is that the humans and vehicles do not yet have a common language for communicating so even if the vehicles drive different than human beings, they could still be safer, even though they make accidents no human would make, they also don't make mistakes that human make, they don't fall asleep, they don't experience road rage or innatention or get drunk or other human errors.

The argument is usually presented as a problem of failure rate estimation where observed failures (accidents involving self-driving cars) are compared against a known failure rate (accident rates of human drivers). Accidents are modeled as discrete, independent and random events that are determined by a (statistically constant) failure rate. The failure rate for fatal accidents can be calculated by dividing the number of accidents with fatalities by the number of vehicle miles traveled. If we consider the 32,166 crashes with fatalities in traffic in the US in 2015 and relate them to the 3.113 billion miles which motor vehicles traveled, then the failure rate is 32,166 / 3.113 billion = 1.03 fatalities per 100 million miles. The probability that a crash with fatality occurs on a stretch of 1 mile is extremely low (0,0000010273%) and the opposite, the success rate, the probability that no accident with fatality occurs on a stretch of 1 vehicle-mile-traveled (VMT) is very high (99,999998972%). By observing cars driving themselves, we can obtain estimates of their failure rate. The confidence that such estimates reflect the true failure rate increases with the number of vehicle miles traveled. Simple formulas for binomial probability distributions can be used to calculate the number of miles which need to be driven without failure to reach a certain confidence level: 291 million miles need to be driven by a self-driving car without fatality to be able to claim with a 95% confidence level that self-driving cars are as reliable as human drivers. This is nearly three times the distance between fatalities that occur during human driving. If we relax the required confidence level to 50%, then at least 67 million miles need to be driven without fatality before we can be confident that self-driving cars are safe. Although this calculation is simple most authors \u2013 including the authors of the RAND report \u2013 use the wrong measures. Instead of dividing the number of crashes involving fatalities (32,166) by VMT, they divide the number of fatalities (35,091) by VMT. This overstates the failure rate of human drivers because a single accident may lead to multiple fatalities and the number of fatalities per fatal accident may depend on many factors other than the reliability of the driver.\n\n\n7.2 Correlations matter!"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "54108733-b4c5-4df6-b815-27e65cdfb8a5", "children": ["a8a26051-b4e5-435a-9038-3b25f2162bbe"]}, "a8a26051-b4e5-435a-9038-3b25f2162bbe": {"id": "a8a26051-b4e5-435a-9038-3b25f2162bbe", "message": {"id": "a8a26051-b4e5-435a-9038-3b25f2162bbe", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1678141839.409678, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Yes, correlations do matter when it comes to analyzing data and drawing conclusions.

At a confidence level of 95% (50%) fully autonomous vehicles must travel 5.4 (1.2) million miles without failure. If we add the 4.387 million police-reported crashes without injury this leads to a failure rate of 201 failures per 100 million VMT. To reach a confidence level of 95% (50%) fully autonomous vehicles must travel 1.5 million (344,000) miles without failure. The RAND report points out that many accidents are not reported. The relationship of actual to reported accidents is not clear; some scientific studies have shown that it may be in the range between 2 and 4. The US Census uses the factor of 2 to estimate the number of accidents from the number of crashes. If we take the census estimate, then self-driving vehicles would have to travel only 745,000 (172,000) miles without accident at a confidence level of 95% (50%) to conclude that self-driving cars are as reliable as cars driven by humans.\n\nIf we consider different types of failures, not just accidents with fatalities, then the number of miles which need to be driven drops greatly. This brings us to the largest flaw in the statistical argument: the probability distributions of accidents with fatalities, accidents with personal injuries, and other accidents are correlated, they are not independent! A car that is much better at avoiding non-fatal accidents than human drivers is also likely to be better than human drivers at avoiding fatal accidents! A self-driving car that has a high rate of fatal crashes will also have a high rate of non-fatal crashes and vice versa. Because we also have other measurable failure rates besides the fatality rate such as the crash rate, the personal injury rate and the overall accident rate, we can gain insights about the level of reliability of self-driving cars much much earlier than the hundreds of millions of miles needed for building confidence by focusing just on the fatality rate.\n\nOne could object that the relationship between the different types of failure rates is not known. Self-driving cars will certainly have a different correlation between their various failure rates than human drivers. But it is very hard to find plausible arguments why self-driving cars might have a property damage or personal injury accident rate much lower than human drivers but could at the same time have a fatality rate that is significantly higher than human drivers.\n\nTherefore there is no reason why a comparison of the reliability of self-driving cars and human drivers should primarily focus on the fatality rate. We should be glad that fatal accidents are not that frequent which immediately means that enormous numbers of miles need to be driven by self-driving cars if we could only use this measure to estimate the safety of self-driving cars.

The quickest way to accumulate test miles is to drive on highways. But highway driving is safer than driving on many other streets. Of the 3.148 billion vehicle miles traveled in the US in 2015 about a quarter occurred on rural or urban interstate highways; however only about 12% of fatal accidents occurred on these roads. Because the average speed varies between different road types, driving time may be a better basis for measuring failure rate than driving distance. It is well known that urban driving is the most difficult scenario for self-driving cars (and probably also for human drivers, although this may be reflected more in the crash statistics than in the fatality statistics because average speeds are lower). Because average speeds differ greatly, using time instead of distance will have a significant effect on the reliability rates and might significantly reduce the number of test miles (while also reducing the incentive for self-driving car companies to accumulate test miles on what many regards as the \u201ceasiest\u201d roads \u2013 interstate highways!).\n\nConceptually, driving is most difficult, when the environment changes, when actions need to be taken. Just driving straight is not much of a challenge. We should look for other measures that come closer to the complexity of driving and the risks associated with driving. A simple proxy that would be easy to calculate for self-driving cars and not impossible to estimate for human driving statistics could be the number of intersections which are passed. This measure contains both an element of distance and risk because a large percentage of accidents occur at intersections. Therefore the number of intersections passed might also be a good independent variable against which to measure reliability rates.\n\nJust using overall miles driven and not differentiating between the different types of environments which the cars are driven in and not differentiating between the risk levels of the routes is intellectually lazy.

Subjectivity: Adlerian therapy is focused on the individual's subjective experience of the world. The therapist seeks to understand the individual's unique perspective and experiences.\n\n3. Teleology: Adler believed that individuals are goal-oriented and purposeful in their behavior. The individual's goals and aspirations are important factors in understanding their behavior.\n\n4. Holism: Adlerian therapy considers the individual as a whole person, rather than just a collection of symptoms or behaviors. The therapist takes into account the individual's physical, emotional, cognitive, and spiritual dimensions.\n\n5. Equality: Adlerian therapy is based on the belief that all individuals are equal and have equal worth. The therapist and the individual work together as equals in the therapeutic relationship.\n\n6. Lifestyle: Adlerian therapy recognizes the importance of the individual's lifestyle, which includes their habits, routines, beliefs, and values. The therapist helps the individual identify their current lifestyle and work towards creating a more positive and fulfilling lifestyle.\n\n7. Early experiences: Adlerian therapy considers the individual's early experiences, including their family of origin, as important factors in shaping their current behavior and lifestyle.\n\n8. Social justice: Adlerian therapy is based on the belief that individuals have a responsibility to contribute to the greater good of society.

Learn more about Alfred Adler.\n\nSocially embedded.\nAn individual does not develop in isolation. A critical goal is to find a place of significance or belonging in the social group. All of our problems are basically social problems, i.e., how we relate to each other. The ability to cooperate and contribute is a measure of social interest and mental health. A well-adjusted person is oriented to and behaves in line with the needs of the situation. A mal-adjusted person has faulty concepts of his or her place in the group, feelings of isolation and inferiority, and mistaken goals, which are compensation for these feelings. Individuals grow up initially feeling a sense of inferiority and compensate by developing a unique sense of superiority or striving for significance (moving from felt minus to perceived plus). Given the inherent social nature of individuals, this striving is seen through the lens of social interest, either adequately fulfilling the tasks of life in socially useful ways or moving on the socially useless side of life and living a world more at odds with others, more in one\u2019s own private logic and personal strivings for superiority.\n\nSubjective.\nHeredity and environment are only viewed as influences. It is an individual\u2019s own ability to interpret information and draw certain conclusions that are most influential in the development of the personality or lifestyle (Ansbacher & Ansbacher, 1956). Reality is what we perceive and the meaning we attribute to these perceptions.\n\nSelf-determining and creative.\nBecause the belief system is created by the individual, it can change. This idea and the inherent social nature of individuals lead to an optimistic view of human nature that people are not victims of forces beyond their control but active participants. And, if given the choice along with proper encouragement, they will choose to be socially useful and find meaning and value in this perspective.\n\nGoal-directed or teleological.\nAll behavior is viewed as movement towards a goal. The perceived place of significance becomes a final cause or the goal to achieve. As an individual moves through the tasks of life, this goal is projected out in front and the person is pulled towards it in all of his or her interactions. Thus, behavior has a purpose although individuals are often unaware of why they do what they do. Once individuals recognize their goals, they can continue behaviors in line with the goals or they can change.\n\nHolism.\nA person is not divided into parts, but is viewed as indivisible. The mind, body, and emotions work together all in the service of the individual\u2019s final fictional goal. A trained individual can see themes and how everything fits into one complete picture.\n\nSocial justice and systemic thinking.\nAdlerians view things from a system perspective. Adler was very sensitive to conditions of oppression and contextual factors that increase the probability of adverse consequences. Where possible, Adlerians will work at a systems level to change conditions impacting people in communities. Rudolf Dreikurs, founder of the Alfred Adler Institute (now Adler University) argued for social equality extensively in his book, Social Equality: The Challenge of Today. Dreikurs was especially focused on community education and empowering families.\n\nPhilosophical orientation.\nWatts highlighted the Adlerian philosophical orientation. He noted it is psycho-educational; present/future-oriented; time-limited; integrates cognitive and systemic perspectives; solidly resonates with post-modern approaches; has common ground with cognitive-behavioral approaches; is compatible with Rational Emotive Therapy and cognitive; is family systems-oriented; and is also aligned with constructivist, solution-focused and narrative therapy approaches."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "3989a606-333f-4dc5-ad93-e6bf4c62c152", "children": ["b06541f1-e8f3-4ac5-b916-5878c08e7e32"]}, "b06541f1-e8f3-4ac5-b916-5878c08e7e32": {"id": "b06541f1-e8f3-4ac5-b916-5878c08e7e32", "message": {"id": "b06541f1-e8f3-4ac5-b916-5878c08e7e32", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1678144517.347548, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["The foundational principles of Adlerian psychology include the belief that individuals are socially embedded and do not develop in isolation.

Feminist theory: This theory focuses on understanding and challenging the social, economic, and political inequalities experienced by women and other marginalized groups. It aims to create a more equitable and just society by promoting gender equality.\n\n4. Postcolonial theory: This theory examines the historical and ongoing effects of colonialism, imperialism, and globalization on marginalized communities around the world. It seeks to understand and challenge the power dynamics that perpetuate inequality and oppression.\n\n5. Queer theory: This theory focuses on understanding and challenging the ways in which heteronormativity and homophobia impact the lives of LGBTQ+ individuals. It aims to create a more inclusive and equitable society for all people, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity.\n\nThese are just a few examples of contemporary philosophies that share similar values and goals as social justice and systemic thinking.

Why, in a time so prosperous, with the stakes so high, would we be going backward in wisdom?\u201d\n\nExponential technology means higher stakes:\n\u201cIt\u2019s natural to assume that the world we grew up in is normal. But nothing about our current world is normal. Because technology is exponential. More advanced societies make progress at a faster rate than less advanced societies\u2014because they\u2019re more advanced.\u201d\n\u201cTechnology is a multiplier of both good and bad. More technology means better good times, but it also means badder bad times.\u201d\n\u201cAs the times get better, they also get more dangerous. More technology makes our species more powerful, which increases risk. And the scary thing is, if the good and bad keep exponentially growing, it doesn\u2019t matter how great the good times become. If the bad gets to a certain level of bad, it\u2019s all over for us.\u201d\nEnvironment changed faster than the human mind:\n\u201cHuman nature is a specific software program optimized for a specific purpose: survival in a small tribe, a long time ago. The modern world is nothing like the environment we were made for.\u201d\n\u201cHuman nature is a constant, and when you put that constant into different environments, it produces different behavior. That makes environment the independent variable. And human environments are complicated\u2014they include the physical environment, the surrounding people and cultures, the prevailing beliefs and belief systems, and the laws and rules.\u201d\n\u201cHuman environments are made up of a complex fabric of culture, norms, values, laws, and prevailing beliefs. Changes to any element of our environment can trigger changes in other parts of the environment, which in turn can cause more changes.\u201d\n\u201cOur environment has been changing at breakneck speed.\u201d\n\u201cAs great as civilization may be, 500 generations isn\u2019t enough time for evolution to take a shit. So now we\u2019re all here living in this fancy new habitat, using brain software optimized to our old habitat.\u201d\nWe don\u2019t have enough wisdom:\n\u201cAs the authors of The Story of Us, we have no mentors, no editors, no one to make sure it all turns out okay. It\u2019s all in our hands. This scares me, but it\u2019s also what gives me hope. If we can all get just a little wiser, together, it may be enough to nudge the story onto a trajectory that points toward an unimaginably good future.\u201d\n\u201cWith the stakes this high, we\u2019d want to be our wisest selves.\u201d\n\u201cWisdom lessons don\u2019t always seem to stick. Unlike technological growth, wisdom seems to oscillate up and down, leading societies to repeat age-old mistakes.\u201d\n\u201cHumans are supposed to mature as they age\u2014but the giant human I live in has been getting more childish each year. Tribalism and political division are on the rise. False narratives and outlandish conspiracy theories are flourishing. Major institutions are floundering. Medieval-style public shaming is suddenly back in fashion. Trust, the critical currency of a healthy society, is disintegrating. And these trends seem to be happening in lots of societies, not just my own.\u201d\n\u201cThis is an unfortunately common pattern through history. People who live through bad times, like the world wars, witness the fragility of human civilization firsthand. This harsh dose of reality has them saying, \u2018never again,\u2019 which gets their priorities in order and leads to wise decisions. These wise decisions protect future society from the kind of bad times they experienced. But when times are good for long enough, we start to get cocky. We forget that the only reason times are good is because of principles fervently agreed upon by people who had been through hell. When we grow complacent about those principles, the safeguards put in place by older generations deteriorate. And the people of good times never see the rise of new bad times until it\u2019s too late to stop them. It\u2019s kind of like a merry-go-round that societies get stuck on:\u201d\nWise People Good Times Foolish People Bad Times\nTwo Minds\n\u201cTwo very different types of intellectual motivation exist simultaneously in our heads \u2026 Internal disagreement pops up in many parts of life, like a constant tug-of-war in our heads\u2014a tug-of-war over our thoughts, our emotions, our values, our morals, our judgments, and our overall consciousness.\u201d\n\nPrimitive Mind Higher Mind\nPrimitive Mind:\n\u201cPrimitive bliss is great, as long as it\u2019s managed by the Higher Mind, who makes sure it\u2019s done in moderation, it\u2019s done for the right reasons, and no one gets hurt.\u201d\n\ngoal is confirmation of its existing beliefs.\na set of coded instructions for how to be a successful animal in the animal\u2019s natural habitat (the coder is natural selection).\nwants to survive and reproduce (and help its offspring reproduce).\nwhat\u2019s important is holding beliefs that generate the best kinds of survival behavior (whether or not those beliefs are actually true).\nbeliefs are usually installed early on in life (often based on the prevailing beliefs of your family, peer group, or broader community).\nsees beliefs as a fundamental part of your identity (and a key to remaining in good standing with the community around you).\nwants you to treat your beliefs as sacred objects and believe them with conviction (the last thing it wants is for you to feel humble about your beliefs or interested in revising them).\nfavorite things include viewpoint/identity confirmation, out-group bashing, and gossip.\nHigher Mind:\n\u201cWhen the Higher Mind is winning the tug-of-war, its staff illuminates our minds with clarity, including awareness of the Primitive Mind and what it\u2019s up to. The Higher Mind understands that primitive pleasures like sex, food, and all-in-good-fun tribalism like sports fandom are enjoyable, and often necessary, parts of a human life. And like a good pet owner, the Higher Mind is more than happy to let the Primitive Mind have its fun.\u201d"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "478ed049-5954-4a48-bbd8-0c2099db1981", "children": ["d495cb49-6fdd-4ede-8cb5-f60d877d71d0"]}, "d495cb49-6fdd-4ede-8cb5-f60d877d71d0": {"id": "d495cb49-6fdd-4ede-8cb5-f60d877d71d0", "message": {"id": "d495cb49-6fdd-4ede-8cb5-f60d877d71d0", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1678207807.421932, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["What is the book \"What's Our Problem?\" by Tim Urban about?\n\n\"What's Our Problem?\" by Tim Urban is a self-help book for societies that focuses on the issues faced by modern society.

From the communal brain perspective, where each individual human mind is a single neuron in a larger brain, it\u2019s as if the axons of the neurons have been hijacked, and any real neural communication ceases.\u201d\n\nInner Self Outer Self\nInner Self (Thought):\nrepresents what a person really thinks.\nOuter Self (Expression):\nrepresents what a person says out loud.\nThe Ladder\n\u201cThe book\u2019s primary tool\u2014a framework that I\u2019ve spent the past six years developing, testing, and refining. I call it the Ladder. The Ladder is a thinking lens\u2014a pair of glasses for the brain to help us better understand the world and ourselves \u2026 For most beliefs, we\u2019re so concerned with where people stand that we often forget the most important thing about what someone thinks: how they arrived at what they think. This is where the Ladder can help. If the Idea Spectrum is a \u2018what you think\u2019 axis, we can use the Ladder as a \u2018how you think\u2019 axis.\u201d\n\nThe Ladder\nHorizontal Vertical Axis\nHigh-Rung Thinking (Scientist & Sports Fan):\n\u201cHigh-rungness seems to be losing its grip on our society\u2019s thinking, its norms, its behavior \u2026 The high-rung immune system is the product of a culture of open discourse, debate, and moral consistency\u2014and the willingness of its members to stand up for that culture in the face of inevitable attempts, from inside and out, to shut it down.\u201d\n\ntruth is the primary value (of high-rung intellectual culture).\nproductive and independent thinking (leaving you free to revise your ideas or even discard them altogether).\nhumble (the humility of the high-rung mindset makes your mind a permeable filter that absorbs life experience and converts it into knowledge and wisdom).\nself-aware, free of bias, and exposes logical fallacies (and roots them out).\nforms hypotheses from the bottom up and follows evidence wherever it takes you (default position on any topic is \u2018I don\u2019t know\u2019).\nunattached to any particular ideas and continually willing to revise your beliefs (rather than adopt the beliefs and assumptions of conventional wisdom, you puzzle together your own ideas, from scratch).\nLow-Rung Thinking (Attorney & Zealot):\n\u201cWhen I look out at the world today, I see a rising epidemic of low-rung thinking and behavior \u2026 Low-rung thinking, low-rung morality, and low-rung tactics all stem from the same concept: When the Primitive Mind is running the show, our minds are in ancient survival mode.\u201d\n\nworking to dutifully serve your ideas, not the other way around (when there\u2019s no amount of evidence that will change your mind about something, it means that idea is your boss).\narrogant (makes your mind a rubber shell that life experience bounces off of).\nshort-sighted and small-minded (thinking and acting with our pettiest emotions).\nlow on self-awareness and high on hypocrisy (we\u2019re our worst selves).\nthe great catch-22 of our species (the biggest threat to humanity is low-rung humanity, and low-rung humanity persists because it has often been the best defense against this very threat).\nidea supremacy (= low-rung thinking + authoritarianism).\nIntellectual Cultures\n\u201cWe can define \u2018culture\u2019 as the unwritten rules regarding \u2018how we do things here\u2019 \u2026 A group\u2019s culture influences its members with a social incentive system. Those who play by the culture\u2019s rules are rewarded with acceptance, respect, and praise, while violating the culture will result in penalties like ridicule, shame, and ostracism \u2026 In the same way the two aspects of your mind compete for control over how you think, a similar struggle happens on a larger scale over how the group thinks. Higher Minds can band together with other Higher Minds and form a kind of coalition, and a group\u2019s collective Primitive Minds can do the same thing.\u201d\n\nIdea Labs Echo Chambers\nIdea Labs:\n\u201cWhen the rules of a group\u2019s intellectual culture mirror the values of high-rung thinking, the group is what I call an Idea Lab. An Idea Lab is an environment of collaborative high-rung thinking. People in an Idea Lab see one another as experimenters and their ideas as experiments. Idea Labs value independent thinking and viewpoint diversity \u2026 In an Idea Lab\u2014where people don\u2019t hesitate to tell you when you\u2019re wrong or biased or hypocritical or gullible\u2014humility and self-awareness are inflicted upon you.\u201d\nEcho Chambers:\n\u201cWhile Idea Labs are cultures of critical thinking and debate, Echo Chambers are cultures of groupthink and conformity. Because while Idea Labs are devoted to a kind of thinking, Echo Chambers are devoted to a set of beliefs the culture deems to be sacred.\u201d\nEmergence Tower\n\u201cI picture society as a giant human\u2014a living organism like each of us, only much bigger \u2026 This concept\u2014a bunch of smaller things joining together to form a giant that can function as more than the sum of its parts\u2014is called emergence. We can visualize it using an Emergence Tower \u2026 In the same way we bounce up and down the Ladder, we\u2019re all over the place on the Emergence Tower \u2026 It\u2019s as if there\u2019s an elevator in the Emergence Tower, and our minds take regular trips up and down.\u201d\n\nEmergence Tower\nLadder Emergence\nGenies:\n\u201cYour brain is a giant of its own, made up of a network of 86 billion neurons \u2026 Language is so important because it allows individual brains to connect, like neurons, to form a larger thinking system: a communal brain \u2026 This is the magic of Idea Lab culture. While individual thinking suffers from bias, a diversity of biases helps the communal brain reduce blind spots.\u201d\n"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "d495cb49-6fdd-4ede-8cb5-f60d877d71d0", "children": ["9ffee97e-7c8d-44f8-960c-4c5e16007705"]}, "9ffee97e-7c8d-44f8-960c-4c5e16007705": {"id": "9ffee97e-7c8d-44f8-960c-4c5e16007705", "message": {"id": "9ffee97e-7c8d-44f8-960c-4c5e16007705", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1678207944.641626, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["What is the book \"Think Again\" by Adam Grant about?"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": false, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"message_type": null, "model_slug": "text-davinci-002-render-sha", "finish_details": {"type": "stop"}, "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "5eb908b7-065d-4d42-a69a-d7491bfe4450", "children": ["fb430035-21dd-41db-83c8-69c17696d3ac"]}, "fb430035-21dd-41db-83c8-69c17696d3ac": {"id": "fb430035-21dd-41db-83c8-69c17696d3ac", "message": {"id": "fb430035-21dd-41db-83c8-69c17696d3ac", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1678208090.116984, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["It is about the epistemological basis of knowledge.

Let\u2019s call this thinking system a genie.\u201d\n\u201cNone of this collaboration comes at the expense of the individual. Quite the opposite, as genies flourish when its members are independent thinkers. So people in a genie get the best of all emergence worlds: they can simultaneously thrive as free individuals and as smaller pieces of a larger system.\u201d\n\u201cThe civilization you\u2019re living in today, with all of its incredible technology, wasn\u2019t created by humans. Humans aren\u2019t nearly smart enough to do that. The amazing world around you was created by genies.\u201d\nGolems:\n\u201cIf the genie is the product of human collaboration, the golem is the emergent property of human obedience. Golems are what happen when humans act like ants \u2026 If the genie is the ultimate Scientist, the golem is the ultimate Zealot\u2014a giant that\u2019s totally certain of itself, totally unable to learn or change its mind, and worse at thinking than the average human.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe human cognitive weaknesses a genie tries to mitigate are the golem\u2019s strengths. Confirmation bias tricks like cherry-picking, motivated skepticism, and motivated reasoning benefit hugely from economies of scale, as the snappiest and most convincing articulations of the sacred ideas spread quickly through the system. Individual biases, all pointing in the same direction in an Echo Chamber, scale up to make the golem\u2019s ultra-biased macro-mind. And while individual minds inside a golem may have doubts about the sacred ideas, the social pressure of Echo Chamber culture keeps the giant as a whole steadfast in its beliefs.\u201d\n\u201cGolems don\u2019t just prefer the Us vs. Them mindset, they rely on it.\u201d\n\u201cA golem\u2019s lifeblood is conformity, anchored by its members\u2019 steadfast belief in its guiding narrative. The stronger and more unified the belief, the stronger and more powerful the golem.\u201d\n\u201cIf golems are on the rise, it\u2019s not because people have changed biologically\u2014it\u2019s because something has changed about the environment.\u201d\n\u201cGolems have infected the societies\u2019 vital organs\u2014their institutions\u2014impeding their ability to function properly and causing a mass crisis of trust.\u201d\nThe Solution\n\u201cHow does a society get out of a downward spiral of confusion and fear? With its opposite: an upward spiral of awareness and courage.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo society wants to enter the \u2018bad times\u2019 phase of the merry-go-round. In a super high-tech era like ours, it\u2019s an especially scary prospect. We live in a time of magical technology, and the power of the human species grows more godlike every year. This power is a double-edged sword, simultaneously paving one road to utopia and another to dystopia. As we move into the deeply uncertain future\u2026there\u2019s never been a more important time to have our wits about us. Which is also why there\u2019s never been a worse time for us to be spiraling down a vortex of confusion and fear. Exponential technology has given us countless gifts. But in the frenzy, we\u2019re forgetting the most important lesson of all: the worst of our nature never lies far beneath the surface \u2026 We really can\u2019t afford to get ourselves from foolish to wise the usual way, via bad times. Somehow, we have to figure how to become wise people directly.\u201d\nWise People Good Times Foolish People\nAwareness (an Inner Self project):\n\u201cThe first part of our solution is awareness, and the gateway to awareness is humility \u2026 The most important thing for us to remember is that we do our rational and moral thinking with a not-that-smart tool that was designed to keep an ancient primate alive. Staying aware of this can help us be our wisest selves and reach our potential \u2026 So the first call to action is: Put your own mask on before helping others.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDo a self-audit: Where in your internal life is your Primitive Mind holding the reins? What are the triggers that activate your Primitive Mind and leave you buried in fog? Where do you tend to be at your best\u2014consistently high rung, wise, and grown up? What is it about those moments that gives your Higher Mind such a strong advantage? Can you replicate that elsewhere?\u201d\n\u201cThink about your beliefs: Play the \u2018why\u2019 game with them, like an annoying four-year-old. Why do you believe what you believe? When did those ideas become your beliefs? Were they installed in you by someone else? Are they beholden to some tribe\u2019s checklist of approved ideas? If they are authentically yours, when were they last updated? Your Primitive Mind thinks your beliefs are sacred objects carved in stone, but they\u2019re not\u2014they\u2019re hypotheses written in pencil, and if you\u2019re thinking up on the high rungs, you should probably be pretty active with the eraser.\u201d\n\u201cThink about your values: If you love a political party or a movement because it stands for your values, and that party or movement slides away from those values, are you sticking with it out of tribal loyalty? Or because your values have truly changed alongside it? If the party or movement has departed from your real values, stick with your values. If you do, you\u2019ll be accused of having changed\u2014of having \u2018left\u2019 the party or movement. But that\u2019s not what happened. It left you, and you stayed true to yourself.\u201d\n\u201cThink about the beliefs of those you disagree with: Do they have any merit? Could you state them to your opponent, in all their complexity, in a way that would make your opponent say, \u2018Yup, that\u2019s what I believe\u2019? Or would you oversimplify or misrepresent those beliefs? If you can\u2019t steel man your opponent\u2019s beliefs, you don\u2019t yet know whether you disagree with them or not. Everyone believes they are fighting on the side of the good, the right, the vulnerable\u2014even your opponents.\u201d\n\u201cThink about your identity: The truth is, you\u2019re not a progressive or a conservative or a moderate or radical or some other political noun. Those are words for ideas, not people. Your mind is way too weird and particular to be locked in a noun or adjective prison. Attaching a political category to your identity is a heavy piece of baggage to carry around, and putting it down makes learning and exploring much easier and less stressful.\u201d\n\u201cThink about people or groups you hate: Who are you disgusted by? Remind yourself that this is almost always a delusion of your Primitive Mind. You certainly don\u2019t have to like everybody. But when you\u2019re disgusted by a person or a group of people, you\u2019ve gotten swallowed up by human craziness. When you find yourself here, try one of these exercises to snap yourself out of it: 1) Think small. Imagine the little details of the life of the person you\u2019re hating: the sticky note they leave in their kid\u2019s lunchbox, the calendar on their wall with little plans written in the squares, the leftovers in their fridge from last night\u2019s home-cooked meal. Like you, everyone else is ultimately just trying to be happy. 2) Think big. Read about the universe. Nothing makes hatred seem more ridiculous than internalizing how vast time and space are. Doing so makes me want to turn to anyone who will listen and hug them and say, \u2018We both exist! On the same tiny planet at the same exact time! Hi!\u2019 3) Think outside yourself. Every person has a unique childhood, a unique set of traumas, unique mental health issues. There are many people not lucky enough to be born as intellectually or emotionally intelligent as you were, not lucky enough to have an upbringing like yours. You have no idea what kind of grief, heartbreak, or other misfortune another person may be suffering through. However awful someone is acting, it would probably make a lot more sense if you could spend a few minutes inside their brain.\u201d\n\u201cPractice thinking \u2018vertically\u2019 about your society, its industries, its cultures, its politics. Slap the Ladder onto all these things and see what they look like. Where do you see high-rung and low-rung psychology or behavior playing out?\u201d\n\u201cEach of us is a work in progress. We\u2019ll never rid our lives of low-rung thinking, but the more we evolve psychologically, the more time we spend thinking from the high rungs and the less time we spend down below. Improving this ratio is a good intellectual goal for all of us.\u201d\nCourage (an Outer Self project):\n\u201cAwareness is a necessary but not sufficient condition for us to right the ship. Because awareness + silence changes nothing. This is where the second ingredient comes into play \u2026 Awareness is about looking out at the world and being able to discern the difference between the low-rung virus and the high-rung immune system. Courage is about becoming part of the immune system instead of enabling the virus \u2026 Just as confusion and fear are contagious, so are awareness and courage. When a person finds the courage to share their real ideas, those ideas spread and build awareness in others.\u201d\n\n\u201cCourage level 1: Stop saying stuff you don\u2019t believe \u2026 Saying things you don\u2019t believe because others want you to is disrespecting your Inner Self. And your Inner Self deserves better.\u201d\n\u201cCourage level 2: Start saying what you really think, in private, with people you know well \u2026 This is when you begin letting your Inner Self show itself in public. Start with the people you\u2019re closest with.\u201d\n\u201cCourage level 3: Go public \u2026 Class. Work. Church. Book clubs. Dinner parties. This isn\u2019t an encouragement to become the insufferable person who always brings up politics. But if you\u2019re in a setting where a conversation is happening and your Inner Self is screaming \u2018I disagree!\u2019\u2014start saying, \u2018I disagree.\u2019 I can almost guarantee that at least some other people in the room will secretly be harboring the same thoughts, and they\u2019ll respect the shit out of you for saying it out loud. You could go even bigger. Start a blog. Start a podcast. Write a book. Tweet a tweet. Spend six years writing a 120,000-word ebook/audiobook. If you already have a platform, start laying your Inner Self on it.\u201d\n\u201cThe danger we face is not an asteroid racing toward Earth or an impending alien invasion\u2014but only ourselves. We got ourselves into this, and I\u2019m pretty sure we can get ourselves out of it.\u201d\n\u201cThere was no shortage of ideas in this book, but I believe one stands out above all: Us vs. Them is always a delusion. The Story of Us isn\u2019t a story of good guys vs. bad guys but one about the tug-of-war that exists within each human head, each community, each society. In this epic story, heading together toward an uncertain fate, there is no Them. Just one big Us.\u201d"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "f3134421-7371-4084-b12a-aa49939d4e3d", "children": ["42f5d006-ef6c-420d-ac07-c4de88e47c3b"]}, "42f5d006-ef6c-420d-ac07-c4de88e47c3b": {"id": "42f5d006-ef6c-420d-ac07-c4de88e47c3b", "message": {"id": "42f5d006-ef6c-420d-ac07-c4de88e47c3b", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1678208143.144546, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["What is the summary of \"The Elephant in the Brain\" by Kevin Simler and Robin Hanson?"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": false, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"message_type": null, "model_slug": "text-davinci-002-render-sha", "finish_details": {"type": "stop"}, "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "c990fd3f-cad5-4a88-934d-b347c8063c42", "children": ["807eb9f3-9423-4263-bc68-0a10bb4f2300"]}, "807eb9f3-9423-4263-bc68-0a10bb4f2300": {"id": "807eb9f3-9423-4263-bc68-0a10bb4f2300", "message": {"id": "807eb9f3-9423-4263-bc68-0a10bb4f2300", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1678208241.088163, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["It is about looking for hidden motives behind our action.

Some still do retain it, as they do the importance of childhood experience, but few narrow Freudians hold views that would have been typical of them in 1930s. Many broad Freudians might not now call themselves Freudian at all. From the mid-1950s the various followers of Freud and emerging post Freudians have tended to abandon the idea of the Unconscious Mind.

While it is true that some psychologists and psychotherapists have moved away from Freud's idea of the unconscious mind as a separate and distinct realm of the psyche, many still believe in the existence of subconscious mental processes that influence behavior and decision-making without conscious awareness. \n\nContemporary cognitive psychology, for example, acknowledges the existence of automatic cognitive processes that operate below the level of conscious awareness, such as perceptual and motor processes. Similarly, research in social psychology has found that our attitudes and beliefs can be influenced by factors that we are not consciously aware of, such as subtle environmental cues or priming effects. \n\nUltimately, the debate about the existence and nature of the subconscious or unconscious mind is ongoing and far from settled.

ROBINSON\nYou know, of course, what the most grating and infuriating human behavior is. It is not when another person is simply being unreasonable. It is when that person is constantly insisting that they are Just Being Reasonable, and wondering why you\u2019re acting so crazy and irrational, while they themselves are in fact being extremely goddamn unreasonable. It is not when they are just wrong, but when they top it off by patronizingly explaining your own views to you, purporting to refute them, while not having the faintest understanding of what those views actually are.\n\nHarvard psychologist Steven Pinker is that guy. He thinks many people are very unreasonable, and makes sweeping claims about their irrationality and moral imbecility, but often doesn\u2019t bother to listen to what they actually say. While insisting for page upon page on the necessity of rationality, he irrationally caricatures and mocks ideas he hasn\u2019t tried to understand. Then, when the people who believe those ideas become upset, he sees this as further proof of their emotion-driven thinking, and becomes even more convinced that he is right. It is a pattern displayed by many of those who are critics of \u201csocial justice\u201d and the political left. (For an entire book about this, see The Current Affairs Rules For Life: On Social Justice and Its Critics.) Pinker, however, takes it to an extreme: Nobody has ever tried to look more Reasonable while being so ignorant and condescending.\n\nPinker\u2019s latest book, Enlightenment Now, makes the case for \u201creason, science, and humanism\u201d and has what he thinks should be an uncontroversial thesis: Human beings have made a lot of progress over the years, and if they embrace humanism and reason, we can solve more problems in the future. Pinker says that he is defending the idea that \u201cwe can apply reason and sympathy to enhance human flourishing,\u201d and admits that this may seem \u201cobvious,\u201d but claims \u201cit is not\u201d because \u201cwe take its gifts for granted\u201d and there are those on both the right and the left who think \u201cthe institutions of modernity have failed and every aspect of life is in deepening crisis,\u201d and lack \u201ca positive vision that sees the world\u2019s problems against a background of progress that it seeks to build upon.\u201d\n\nBanal as this may seem, while Enlightenment Now was \u201cBill Gates\u2019 new favorite book of all time,\u201d reactions elsewhere have been so polarized that the Chronicle of Higher Education ran an article entitled \u201cWhy Do People Love To Hate Steven Pinker?\u201d The author, Tom Bartlett, seemed mystified that anyone could dislike Pinker.\n\n[T]he pushback against his more recent work, beginning with The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined (Viking, 2011), feels harsher, more personal, at times tinged with real anger. Which is surprising, in part because his message \u2014 that, hey, despite some significant challenges we\u2019re making progress as a species \u2014 seems benign enough. Pinker doesn\u2019t come off like a bomb-thrower. \u2026 How did such a nice guy become such a big target?\u2026 One reason [for negative reviews, Pinker thinks,] is simply that it\u2019s more enjoyable to take shots at the guy writing popular books than to praise him, and he cites a study that suggests reviewers who pan books are considered more intelligent. The book he\u2019s working on now, tentatively titled \u201cDon\u2019t Go There: Common Knowledge and the Science of Civility, Hypocrisy, Outrage, and Taboo,\u201d will attempt to unpack the psychology behind such outsized responses.\n\nThe Chronicle suggested that \u201cby proclaiming the gospel of progress,\u201d Pinker \u201chas made a lot of enemies.\u201d (It cited a cartoon printed in Current Affairs as an example of the \u201chate\u201d Pinker gets.) Pinker\u2019s friend Jerry Coyne thinks people dislike Pinker because he is famous. This confirms Pinker\u2019s own view, which is that \u201cintellectuals hate progress\u201d and become upset at him because he dares to use quantitative data to assess the human condition. \u201cIntellectuals who call themselves progressive really hate progress\u2026 the idea of progress that rankles the chattering class [is] the Enlightenment belief that by understanding the world we can improve the human condition.\u201d Pinker writes about the reactions to his previous book:\n\n\u201cThe objections revealed not just a skepticism about the data but also an unpreparedness for the possibility that the human condition has improved. Many people lack the conceptual tools to ascertain whether progress has taken place or not. Here are stylized versions of dialogues I have often had with questioners: So violence has declined linearly since the beginning of history! Awesome!\u201d\n\nI would like to posit an alternative explanation: Those of us who react negatively to Pinker\u2019s work do not do so because we are statistically illiterate, or \u201clack the conceptual tools to ascertain whether progress has taken place,\u201d or because we hate progress. Rather, Pinker is controversial because he is dismissive and contemptuous of anyone who disagrees with his highly debatable propositions, and he presents dubious political opinions as mere objective analysis of data."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "eca0cbee-73ee-40f5-bd89-6c52d95fa326", "children": ["e294a586-8755-4490-838c-ae230d957935"]}, "e294a586-8755-4490-838c-ae230d957935": {"id": "e294a586-8755-4490-838c-ae230d957935", "message": {"id": "e294a586-8755-4490-838c-ae230d957935", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1678208890.36111, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["This article by Nathan J.

Perhaps, then, the debate is not about the \u201chuman flourishing is a positive\u201d and \u201cvaccines exist now and are good\u201d parts of the book.\n\nOne thing that pisses some of us off about Pinker\u2019s work is that, while he presents himself as \u201csuch a nice guy,\u201d in the words of the Chronicle, a person who just loves Facts and Data, he peppers his books with nasty, utterly irrational swipes at those to the left of him. Let us look at a small sample (I\u2019m not even sure these are the most extreme):  \n\n\u201cMany social critics have expressed nostalgia for the era of factories, mines, and mills, probably because they never worked in one.\u201d\n\u201cThose who condemn modern capitalist societies for callousness toward the poor are probably unaware of how little the pre-capitalist societies of the past spent on poor relief.\u201d\n\u201cAn axiom of progressive opinion, especially in universities, is that we continue to live in a deeply racist, sexist, and homophobic society\u2014which would imply that progressivism is a waste of time, having accomplished nothing after decades of struggle.\u201d\n\u201cIt may be satisfying to demonize the fossil fuel corporations that sell us the energy we want, or to signal our virtue by making conspicuous sacrifices, but these indulgences won\u2019t prevent destructive climate change\u2026 The human moral sense is not particularly moral; it encourages dehumanization (\u2018politicians are pigs\u2019) and punitive aggression (\u2018make the polluters pay\u2019)\u201d\n\u201cSome feminist theories have embraced the Blank Slate and with it an authoritarian political philosophy that would give the government sweeping powers to implement their vision of gender-free minds.\u201d\n\u201cStarting in the 1970s, the mainstream environmental movement latched onto a quasi-religious ideology, greenism, which can be found in the manifestoes of activists as diverse as Al Gore, the Unabomber, and Pope Francis\u2026 Greenism is laced with misanthropy, including an indifference to starvation, an indulgence in ghoulish fantasies of a depopulated planet, and Nazi-like comparisons of human beings to vermin\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to retire the morality play in which modern humans are a vile race of despoilers and plunderers who will hasten the apocalypse unless they undo the Industrial Revolution, renounce technology, and return to an ascetic harmony with nature\u2026 We must not accept the narrative that humanity inexorably destroys every part of the environment\u2026 [Climate justice warriors] advocate a regime of \u2018sustainable development.\u2019 \u2026 Climate justice warriors [say] that rather than enriching poorer nations, we should impoverish rich ones, switching back, for example, to \u2018labor-intensive agriculture.\u2019 (to which an appropriate reply is: \u2018you first\u2019)\u201d\n\u201cMany on the left encourage identity politicians and social justice warriors who downplay individual rights in favor of equalizing the standing of races, classes, and genders, which they see as being pitted in zero-sum competition.\u201d\n\u201cWe have seen that when a creed becomes attached to an in-group, the critical faculties of its members can be disabled, and there are reasons to think this has happened within swaths of academia.. [A] faction of academic culture composed of hard-left faculty, student activists, and an autonomous diversity bureaucracy\u2026 has become aggressively illiberal. Anyone who disagrees with the assumption that racism is the cause of all problems is called a racist\u2026 [Professors] have been subjected to Stalinesque investigations for politically incorrect opinions\u2026[The left has been captured by] identity politicians, political correctness police, and social justice warriors.\u201d\nI say \u201cirrational\u201d because some of this stuff isn\u2019t even logical. It does not follow from the fact that \u201cwe continue to live in a deeply racist, sexist, and homophobic society\u201d that prior social movements have accomplished nothing. If environmentalists believed humanity \u201cinexorably\u201d destroyed nature, we wouldn\u2019t be pushing for a Green New Deal. Most of this is just vicious, inaccurate cartoonish misrepresentation. I doubt you could find anyone to affirm that racism is the cause of \u201call problems.\u201d Do those who say capitalist countries are ungenerous think feudal societies were more generous? Of course we don\u2019t. Do we express nostalgia for the era of child labor and workhouses? No. Do mainstream environmentalists demand a \u201crenunciation of technology\u201d? Even radical anti-civilization anarcho-primitivist John Zerzan is on radio and podcasts. What Pinker calls the \u201cdemonization\u201d of fossil fuel companies is the recognition that they engaged in practices they knew to be destructive, misleading the public to maintain profits the same way tobacco companies did. It\u2019s important to treat this as what it is: fraud and theft, because those who are responsible for knowingly causing damage ought to pay for it. \u201cMake polluters pay\u201d is not immoral \u201cpunitive aggression\u201d but an application of basic tort law principles."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "e294a586-8755-4490-838c-ae230d957935", "children": ["713d4333-bf4a-4583-9892-e498b379a65c"]}, "713d4333-bf4a-4583-9892-e498b379a65c": {"id": "713d4333-bf4a-4583-9892-e498b379a65c", "message": {"id": "713d4333-bf4a-4583-9892-e498b379a65c", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1678208929.825782, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["It seems that the issue some people have with Pinker's work is not necessarily the message of progress or the importance of reason, but rather the way he presents his arguments and his treatment of those on the left.

When anthropologist Jason Hickel critiqued Pinker\u2019s theses in the Guardian, Pinker snapped that Hickel was a \u201cMarxist idealogue\u201d while leaving many of Hickel\u2019s arguments unaddressed. Is this what the Chronicle called Pinker\u2019s \u201crelentless friendly persuasion, a kind of indefatigable reasonableness\u201d?\n\nI do not mean to dwell too much on the tone of Pinker\u2019s writing, but it\u2019s important to see how dishonest centrist critics of social justice rhetoric can be. Pinker treats the left as hysterically overstating its case, of calling everybody racists and despoilers, even as he brands them Nazis and Stalinists. One of the common themes I see in critics of social justice politics is engaging in the very thing they\u2019re accusing the left of doing. There are countless examples of this in Pinker\u2019s work. For example, in The Blank Slate, which is strongly critical of mainstream feminism, he cites Gloria Steinem saying: \u201cWhat you need is people who see through literature like Andrea Dworkin, who see through law like me, to see through art and create the uncompromised woman\u2019s visual vocabulary.\u201d Pinker concludes from this quote that Steinem is \u201coblivious to the danger inherent in a few intellectuals\u2019 arrogating the role of deciding which art and literature the rest of society will enjoy.\u201d This is an incredibly audacious remark for a book with entire sections on which art is the Good Art and which art is \u201cugly, baffling, and insulting art\u201d:  \n\n\u201cIn this chapter I will diagnose the malaise of the arts and humanities and offer some suggestions for revitalizing them\u2026 Once we recognize what modernism and postmodernism have done to the elite arts and humanities, the reasons for their decline and fall become all too obvious.\u201d\n\nWhen you say it, it\u2019s dangerous elitism. When I say it, it\u2019s Science! \n\nHypocrisy doesn\u2019t make the underlying arguments untrue, but I think it\u2019s critical to explaining why the left can end up with an unwarranted reputation for being unreasonable and emotional: Our critics operate just as much from \u201cfeeling\u201d and instinct, but insist that they\u2019re just being Objective. My colleague Aisling McCrea has written about how mere invocation of the word \u201clogic\u201d is used as proof that one is being logical. \u201cReason\u201d becomes a brand rather than a description of an actual process by which the other side\u2019s arguments are carefully analyzed and responded to fairly. (I\u2019ve shown how both Sam Harris and Ben Shapiro mangle basic reasoning.)\n\nA core part of actual reasoning is humility, critically examining your own positions and the possible arguments against them. At this, Steven Pinker does not excel. Frequently, when he responds to critics, he does not respond to actual critics, but uses his own paraphrases of the critics\u2019 arguments, the \u201cstylized versions.\u201d Thus he poses himself questions like \u201cWhy were you so mean to Nietzsche?\u201d to answer rather than engaging closely with the actual philosophers who criticized Pinker for wondering why Nietzsche, with his \u201csociopathic ravings,\u201d \u201ccontinues to be a darling of the academic humanities.\u201d Pinker says his critics thought \u201cI had no right to criticize anything [Nietzsche] said.\u201d In fact, the critics mostly just thought he sounded like he hadn\u2019t read a single book or asked a single philosopher why they found value in Nietzsche. This is a consistent tendency in Pinker\u2019s writing, and it makes him a shoddy and irresponsible academic: If you choose to misrepresent the arguments against you, and exaggerate to make them look ludicrous, you\u2019re the Ideologue in the room, and definitely not a serious scholar."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "713d4333-bf4a-4583-9892-e498b379a65c", "children": ["2548f732-e451-4879-bd78-64b1700382e7"]}, "2548f732-e451-4879-bd78-64b1700382e7": {"id": "2548f732-e451-4879-bd78-64b1700382e7", "message": {"id": "2548f732-e451-4879-bd78-64b1700382e7", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1678209010.351497, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["The passage you provided offers a critical analysis of Steven Pinker's writing style and arguments.

Yet they reinforce many right-wing talking points and accepting some of their conclusions would have extremely destructive political consequences. I actually agree with perhaps 80 percent or more of what is contained in Enlightenment Now, insofar as it is simply presenting statistics showing that crime has dropped and we are not presently in a world war, or making arguments for secular humanism and democracy. But he also (1) staunchly defends the inequality produced by free-market capitalism, (2) is irrationally dismissive of the scale of the risks facing humankind, (3) trivializes present-day human pain and suffering, (4) whitewashes U.S. crimes and minimizes the dangers of U.S. military aggression, (5) repeats right-wing smears about anti-racist and feminist ideas, and (6) has a colossal ignorance about the workings of politics and the struggle necessary to achieve further human progress. Pinker is one of those people who believes that Donald Trump\u2019s presidency represents a \u201cbacksliding\u201d into unreason after a long period of Progress, and that we simply need to appreciate the Progress and commit ourselves to maintaining and steadily improving upon the pre-Trump status quo.\n\nPinker\u2019s broad thesis is that, aside from a few unfortunate statistical blips like the Second World War and the rapid acceleration of climate change, for the most part life on Earth has been getting better all the time. Usually, he qualifies this by saying that Of Course There Are Still Terrible Problems and he\u2019s Not Saying This Is The Best We Can Possibly Do (this is how he distinguishes himself from Professor Pangloss, who already thought the world was as good as it could get). For the most part, he remembers to add the fine print disclaimer \u201c*Results may vary, your experience of Progress may not match the aggregated median trend.\u201d But sometimes he accidentally lapses and says things like: \u201cEverything is amazing\u2026 None of us are as happy as we ought to be, given how amazing our world has become.\u201d\n\nThis is, of course, false, insulting, and enraging. Even assuming Pinker\u2019s thesis is accurate, life is clearly not \u201camazing\u201d for everyone, like the tens of millions of refugees around the world. \u201cNone of us\u201d? The spectacle of a Harvard professor, with millions of dollars in book sales and friends among the jet-setting global elite, telling the Rohingya to perk up, and Black Americans to be more grateful for iPhones, is grotesque. Pinker may reply that by \u201cus\u201d he does not mean everyone, just the statistically average people for whom things have gotten better. But this is precisely the point: Casually switching between \u201cthings are better at the median than during 1940 or 1410\u201d and \u201ceverything is amazing\u201d is appallingly insensitive to the reality of pain and deprivation. \u201cIf we have a shred of cosmic gratitude,\u201d Pinker writes, we \u201cought to be\u201d happier. \u201cAn American in 2019,\u201d he writes \u201cwill live nine years longer\u201d and \u201chave an additional eight hours a week of leisure,\u201d which they can spend \u201creading on the Web, listening to music on a smartphone, streaming movies on high-definition TV, \u2026 or dining on Thai food instead of spam fritters.\u201d When people who are not among the Americans who can do these things read a passage like that, is it any wonder that they get a little ticked? The Thai food in Cambridge may be excellent, but my friend who teaches elementary school in Detroit still has students coming to school hungry each day. I am sure they\u2019d happily take a spam fritter, though perhaps they just lack a \u201cshred of cosmic gratitude.\u201d"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "ff778c72-076e-4307-a282-ca6054ef298b", "children": ["6b326210-9a5b-4d91-a671-71129dd5c8c9"]}, "6b326210-9a5b-4d91-a671-71129dd5c8c9": {"id": "6b326210-9a5b-4d91-a671-71129dd5c8c9", "message": {"id": "6b326210-9a5b-4d91-a671-71129dd5c8c9", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1678209154.315285, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Thank you for sharing more of the article.

However, we can explore some related concepts to see if they might be what you're looking for.\n\nFirst, a quick review: a sphere is a two-dimensional surface that is curved like the surface of a ball. It is an example of a \"closed\" surface, meaning that it has no boundary. A horn torus, on the other hand, is a three-dimensional shape that looks like a donut with a horn attached to it. It is an example of a \"non-orientable\" surface, meaning that it is impossible to assign a consistent notion of \"left\" and \"right\" to every point on the surface.\n\nOne way to think about a Riemann surface is as a generalization of the complex plane. It is a two-dimensional surface that is locally modeled on the complex plane, meaning that small patches of the surface look like small patches of the complex plane. However, Riemann surfaces can have more complicated global topologies than the complex plane. For example, a Riemann surface could be a sphere with one or more punctures (points removed), or a torus (doughnut shape) with one or more holes.\n\nWith this in mind, one possible interpretation of a \"Riemann horn torus\" might be a non-orientable surface that is locally modeled on the complex plane and has a global topology resembling that of a horn torus. Such a surface would have to be constructed carefully, since the horn torus has a boundary (the \"hole\" in the center of the torus) whereas a Riemann surface must be a closed surface.\n\nAnother possible interpretation of a \"Riemann horn torus\" might be a non-orientable surface that is locally modeled on the complex plane and has a global topology resembling that of a horn torus, but with some additional geometric or analytic structure. For example, one could ask for the surface to be equipped with a conformal structure, meaning that angles and distances are preserved under local transformations.\n\nOverall, the concept of a \"Riemann horn torus\" is not well-defined, but there are related concepts in Riemannian geometry and complex analysis that one could explore further."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": false, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"message_type": null, "model_slug": "text-davinci-002-render-sha", "finish_details": {"type": "stop"}, "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "7100ad85-de9b-4e33-9703-1b99ba9706d1", "children": ["3ae0a764-5247-4038-a3ba-18cf6134ec42"]}, "3ae0a764-5247-4038-a3ba-18cf6134ec42": {"id": "3ae0a764-5247-4038-a3ba-18cf6134ec42", "message": {"id": "3ae0a764-5247-4038-a3ba-18cf6134ec42", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1677874180.291843, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Horn Torus Models for the Riemann \nSphere and Division by Zero \nWolfgang W.

In the model, the \nzero point and the point at inf i nity are attaching and surprisingly enough, \nwe can introduce analytical structure of conformality in the horn torus. This \nmodel seems to be fundamental and important for us. \n1 \nIn Section 1, we introduce the horn torus model with the Puha mapping \nthat gives one to one mapping from the extended complex plane onto a horn \ntorus through the stereographic projection mapping from the Riemann sphere \nonto the extended complex plane and in Section 2, we state simple properties \nof the Puha mapping. \nIn Section 3, we will introduce a conformal mapping from the extended \ncomplex plane onto the horn torus by modifying the Puha mapping. This \nintroduction by D\u00e4umler is geometrical and delicate, and the mapping will \nbe very complicated. Therefore, we will give a complete conf i rmation for \nhis conformal mapping analytically in Section 5. In Section 4, we give the \nelementary properties of the D\u00e4umler conformal mapping. In Section 5, we \nwill simply refer to the division by zero in connection with the horn torus \nmodel.\n1Horn torus model \nWe will consider the three circles represented by \n\u03be2+ ( \u03b6 \u2212 \n1 \n2 )2 \n= (1 \n2 )2 \n, \n( \u03be \u2212 \n1 \n4 )2 \n+ ( \u03b6 \u2212 \n1 \n2 )2 \n= (1 \n4 )2 \n,(1.1) \nand ( \n\u03be + \n1 \n4 )2 \n+ ( \u03b6 \u2212 \n1 \n2 )2 \n= (1 \n4 )2 \n. \nBy rotation on the space (\u03be,\u03b7,\u03b6) on the (x,y) plane as in \u03be = x,\u03b7 = y around \n\u03b6 axis, we will consider the sphere with 1/2 radius as the Riemann sphere \nand the horn torus made in the sphere. \nThe stereographic projection mapping from (x,y) plane to the Riemann \nsphere is given by \u03be = \nx \nx2+ y2+ 1, \n\u03b7 = \ny \nx2+ y2+ 1, \nand \u03b6 = \nx2+ y2 \nx2+ y2+ 1. \n2 \nOf course, \u03be2+ \u03b72= \u03b6(1 \u2212 \u03b6), \nand x = \n\u03be \n1 \u2212 \u03b6 \n,y = \n\u03b7 \n1 \u2212 \u03b6 \n.(1.2) \nThe mapping from (x,y) plane to the horn torus is given by \n\u03be = 2x\u221ax2+ \ny2 \n(x2+ y2+ 1)2 \n, \n\u03b7 = 2y\u221ax2+ \ny2 \n(x2+ y2+ 1)2 \n, \nand \u03b6 = \n(x2+ y2\u2212 1)\u221ax2+ \ny2 \n(x2+ y2+ 1)2 \n+ \n1 2. \nThis Puha mapping has a simple and beautiful geometrical correspon- \ndence. At i rst for the plane we consider the stereographic mapping to the \nRiemann sphere and next, we consider the common point of the line con- \nnecting the point and the center (0,0,1/2) and the horn torus.

Install VcXsrv in Windows by downloading the installer from the VcXsrv website and running it.\n\n2. Open VcXsrv by searching for \"XLaunch\" in the Windows Start menu and running the program.\n\n3. Follow the XLaunch setup wizard to configure your X server. The default settings should be fine for most purposes, but make sure to check the \"Disable access control\" option on the \"Extra settings\" screen.\n\n4. Start an SSH session to your WSL2 Ubuntu instance using the `-X` option to enable X11 forwarding:\n\n   ```\n   ssh -X username@wsl2-ubuntu-ip-address\n   ```\n\n   Replace `username` with your WSL2 Ubuntu username and `wsl2-ubuntu-ip-address` with the IP address of your WSL2 Ubuntu instance.\n\n5.

You can use the following command to install Firefox:\n\n   ```\n   sudo apt-get update\n   sudo apt-get install firefox\n   ```\n\n6. Test X11 forwarding by running a graphical application such as `xeyes`:\n\n   ```\n   xeyes\n   ```\n\n   This should launch a window with a pair of eyes that follow your mouse cursor.\n\n7. Finally, set the `BROWSER` environment variable to the path of your graphical browser executable.

Try running `xdg-open` with the `-v` or `--verbose` option to get more information about what is happening:\n\n   ```\n   xdg-open -v http://example.com\n   ```\n\n   Look for any error messages or warnings that might indicate why `xdg-open` is not working.\n\n3. Try manually setting the `xdg-open` script to use `chrome` as the default browser by creating a symbolic link:\n\n   ```\n   sudo ln -s /usr/bin/google-chrome-stable /usr/bin/x-www-browser\n   ```\n\n   This will create a symbolic link from the `google-chrome-stable` executable to `/usr/bin/x-www-browser`, which is the location where `xdg-open` looks for the default browser.\n\nIf none of these steps work, you may need to try a different method for opening URLs in your default browser, such as manually running `./chrome` or using a text-based browser like Lynx."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": false, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"message_type": null, "model_slug": "text-davinci-002-render-sha", "finish_details": {"type": "stop"}, "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "793d1e35-e8d3-47b2-97f8-b4c43b524154", "children": ["6f90a3bf-ea00-4680-a392-3a6471ef7ef2"]}, "6f90a3bf-ea00-4680-a392-3a6471ef7ef2": {"id": "6f90a3bf-ea00-4680-a392-3a6471ef7ef2", "message": {"id": "6f90a3bf-ea00-4680-a392-3a6471ef7ef2", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1677708780.77471, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["its to install gptchat api wrapper. it needs to run \"gptchat install\" open a browser to input key with a selector, but it isn't opening a browser"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "6051afcd-cb1e-44de-9e51-6639cb4886cf", "children": ["66b0ef83-a5d3-4cdd-852d-0764a76823f0"]}, "66b0ef83-a5d3-4cdd-852d-0764a76823f0": {"id": "66b0ef83-a5d3-4cdd-852d-0764a76823f0", "message": {"id": "66b0ef83-a5d3-4cdd-852d-0764a76823f0", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1677708807.996032, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["It's possible that the `gptchat` command is not properly detecting your default browser.

Please don't jump ahead.\n  The science may have a rough spot or two, but the abstract model itself becomes clear and self-evident.\n  The trees become a forest.\n  The Table of Conquents\n  Part 1a Objectivity and Subjectivity in Space and Time\n  E equals mc squared can be rewritten as energy is to mass, as space squared is to time squared.\n  The four elements of reality each separated from the others.\n  Space and time are the axes of the field continuum for the objects of the mass-energy dichotomy to exist in.\n  Existence is mass-energy motion in space-time.\n  Motion through space and time are both quantized.\n  One plank space per one plank time is the speed of exchange bosons of information.\n  Fermions must be slower, including zero relative speed.\n  Tachyons must be faster, including infinite relative speed.\n  In the field of action, the three axes of space are mutually perpendicular.\n  Three mutually perpendicular plane pairs make a cube.\n  The diagonals on a cube make a dual tetrahedron.\n  The three axes of time are mutually parallel, past, present, and future.\n  Mass-energy objects resonate as standing waves in the present reflect on the past and project into the future.\n  To be is to resonate in the constantly changing present with all other things.\n  That resonance projects into the future, space and time, and reflects into the past.\n  Geometric structures have internal resonances, displayed by passing planes through solids or lines through planes.\n  Motion is through time and space together, so on the diagonal.\n  Plane passage through diagonals on a cube is through tetrahedrons.\n  Resonant symmetries of the tetrahedron's plane passage are square and triangular.\n  Energy exchanges are quantized.\n  Changes in resonance states is music.\n  Being is harmonious participation in the resonant exchange.\n  Resonant waves exist on surfaces of opposing tensions and can be straight or curved, parallel or perpendicular, in-phase or out-of-phase.\n  These standing waves divide finite lines, either straight or curved, into a quantized number of divisions.\n  Plane passage through increasingly faceted objects describes a path that is increasingly more curved than angled.\n  Plane passage through a cone shows curves associated with orbital dynamics.\n  The closed elliptical, flat parabolic and open hyperbolic curves on a cone yield the sphere, cylinder and torus as extended objects.\n  A flat straight path on the surface of a cone yields curves that are similar to a sectioning plane,\n  but the type of curve is dependent on the cone's height-to-base ratio,\n  not the angle of the sectioning plane relative to the edge of that cone.\n  All things exist as resonating standing waves, with node points that are fixed points that evenly divide the enclosed finite space.\n  One standing wave resonates with another standing wave via their common node points.\n  Simpler ratios resonate more strongly than complex ratios, but all fractions resonate.\n  Standing waves appear to move in two opposing directions at the same time.\n  This bistable image of resonant interaction shows the interference of a dual reality like the objective and the subjective.\n  The two flows interfere both as constructive at 90 degrees and as destructive at 180 degrees to each other, in phase or angle.\n  The unity is described as indescribable, a self-contradictory entity, but nothing is directly describable.\n  Only attributes of any entity can be described.\n  Attributes invoke separations.\n  The number of separations or divisions of the whole speaks to the kind of divisions of the whole.\n  Divided attributes of an entity only tangentially describe that entity.\n  Any entity can be divided by any number.\n  When you divide the universe into four parts, one reality you get is mass, energy, space, and time.\n  Each and every division of the whole is itself a whole with its own divisions, a fractal structure.\n  Each number of divisions of the whole has its own abstract table of correspondence.\n  Duality, objectivity and subjectivity compete and cooperate as complementary aspects of a single event of being,\n  both together and neither alone, like space and time, parallel and perpendicular.\n  Objectively, all things are different from each other.\n  Subjectively, all things are similar to each other.\n  Objective deductive reason looks for differences in the similar,\n  and subjective inductive reason looks for similarities in the different.\n  This is subjective abstraction as compared to objective concreteness."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all",

 The three objective actions are be, do, and have.\n  The three kinds of verbs.\n  The three subjective actions are feel, know, and interact or resonate.\n  Without specific endorsement, I should point out that in Western Judeo-Christian religions, heaven and earth correspond to subjective and objective reality.\n  Father, Son, and Holy Spirit correspond to the three subjective actions of existence.\n  Father is the feeling of love, Son is the knowing of the world as man, and Holy Spirit is the interaction between man and God.\n  Objective reality and subjective reality are each a part of the other.\n  Both exist together, neither exists alone.\n  Abstractly, all things, including consciousness, exist according to the same set of rules.\n  Objective and subjective realities resonate in each other, in the present.\n  Patterns projected to persist in the future support continued existence.\n  Reflected past reality informs the present with resonant echoes of similar actions.\n  Objective being and having oppose each other.\n  Subjective feeling and interaction oppose each other.\n  Objective doing and subjective knowing oppose each other.\n  Doing and knowing both mean change.\n  The dual tetrahedron is the only polyhedron set that is its own dual.\n  It is super symmetrical.\n  No matter how you orient the two tetrahedrons relative to each other, all six pairs of edge lines that cross will always touch.\n  It has a square symmetry and it has a triangular symmetry depending upon perspective.\n  Centers can move apart.\n  Four different directions, two different ways each.\n  And the corners can move together.\n  Three different ways times two each is a total of six.\n  So it's eight open states and six closed states.\n  The three objective actions of existence resonate indirectly with the three subjective actions of existence.\n  Where dual tetrahedrons edge lines touch and cross, there is a mutual node point for both tetrahedrons.\n  The common node point for the crossing edge lines divides each line by changing fractions as the orientation between the tetrahedrons change.\n  Exchanges between edge line waves on the two tetrahedrons creates common opposing motions between them.\n  The circular motion at the vertices creates inertia and tension for the waves to resonate on.\n  Change the orientation between the tetrahedron changes their resonant state of existence.\n  Changing resonances becomes harmonious progressions.\n  Simpler resonance supports higher resonances.\n  Higher resonances guide simpler resonances.\n  Delayed or deferred gains of resonance on one level of vibration may impose gains on another level.\n  Gain and loss become relative.\n  Objectivity and subjectivity both cooperate and compete for gain.\n  The local geometry of the spacetime field.\n  The more straight and curved extensions of spacetime are in contact with other extensions,\n  the more complex and higher dimensional the resonations can be.\n  The mass of several small circles or spheres is gravitationally closer to another circle than one big circle.\n  The force of attraction between circles drives dividing the mass to reduce the distance between centers.\n  The opposing force is to shorten the distance around a center.\n  This happens when two circles areas combine into one larger circle,\n  like two soap bubbles combining into one.\n  The force to shorten the distance between circles centers\n  and the force to shorten the distance around circle centers oppose each other.\n  Within a circle, other circles force toward the edge is centrifugal.\n  The same opposition of forces between and around are around instead of between.\n  The unit circle is the base limit for extensions into space both internal and external.\n  Two circles can overlap.\n  There are various stages of overlap corresponding to Venn diagrams for logical states of being.\n  There are no straight lines, only infinitely large radius circles,\n  that resonate inside and outside of smaller circles.\n  Straighter inside means larger outside.\n  If the tangent line between any two concentric circles is constant,\n  then so is the area between those circles.\n  This is Mannequin's theorem.\n  When the inner circle approaches zero, the tangent resembles a diameter.\n  The expanding circle pair will reflect exact numbers around at specific relative sizes.\n  Any two reinforced resonator circles will have equal areas\n  and a rational ratio of circle divisions to resonate with.\n  Various reflective resonances within a circle each has its own projective resonance outside the circle,\n  which is inside another circle.\n  The field of interaction can be either finite or infinite and either bounded or unbounded.\n  Consecutive extensions make a line.\n  Consecutive lines of extensions make a surface.\n  Adjacent lines of extensions can be in step or out of step with each other.\n  These two tessellations have different resonant flows,\n  ways for circles to contact its neighbors.\n  Perpendicular extensions have flows along two axes.\n  Staggered or triangular extensions have flows around three axes.\n  Plain passage through a tetrahedron shows both tessellations from different perspectives.\n  A tetrahedron is the smallest such closest packing arrangement in three dimensions.\n  It has two spheres on each of six edges.\n  This smallest tetrahedron has no center sphere.\n  The smallest amount of closest packing with spheres that has a central sphere\n  forms a tetrahedron with five spheres on a side.\n  Just the spheres that touch a central sphere together form the vector matrix.\n  Stacking similar two-dimensional surfaces into three dimensions yields varying crystal structures.\n  Offset stacking into gaps gives the square-based pyramid and the triangular-based tetrahedron.\n  Both these stackings are the closest packing of spheres seen from different perspectives.\n  Square stacking perspective has one gap per extension.\n  Triangular stacking perspective has two gaps per extension\n  and has stacking options unavailable in square stacking."]}, "status": "finished_successfully",

alone.\n  Similar patterns interfering can make an interference pattern\n  that looks similar to the patterns that is composed of, but on a different scale.\n  When both patterns are in the same plane,\n  the interference pattern is in a fixed relative position to the two patterns,\n  but if the two patterns lie on different planes,\n  then the interference pattern may become fixed relative to the observer\n  and no longer the component patterns.\n  Driving through an orchard, the trees pass by,\n  but the lanes between the trees holds their positions.\n  The appearance of interference patterns changes when the contributing patterns change.\n  There are three kinds of change between patterns relative to the observer,\n  across, along and around.\n  Higher energy, muons, towels, strange top, charm, and bottom quarks\n  have shorter wavelengths.\n  Tetrahedrons orient themselves relative to nodes between waves.\n  Higher energy means shorter wavelengths and smaller change in orientation\n  between tetrahedrons, catalyzing the full change of the electron in the upper down particle.\n  The color force reflected inside the baryon also projects outside the baryon\n  as the strange force of the mesons.\n  This arrangement of particles and waves sequenced as their forces cool out and separate.\n  There are corresponding bosons and fermions for each force as its symmetry is broken.\n  As expansion and cooling causes the forces to each break symmetry in turn,\n  even the electromagnetic force can cool to the electric force and the magnetic force.\n  Among all forces, the Higgs field is the same everywhere,\n  and the weak force mediates intermittent changes and then disappears.\n  The weak force does not participate in resonant interaction to persist.\n  This leaves four forces to match the four elements of existence.\n  When dividing the universe into four parts, there are six connections between those parts.\n  This is the tetrahedron of existence, the objective dichotomy and the subjective continuum of being.\n  Dividing the circle by five and using the square root of five show the ratio of five,\n  but so do many other geometric constructions.\n  Dividing the unity by six shows three axes of space and three axes of time for resonances to reflect and project.\n  Stressed nodes of the past will echo similar structures back to the present.\n  Dividing the unity by seven shows how divisions have a circular nature in the progression to the next octave of resonance.\n  All things resonate.\n  Coloring each number in different bases shows the patterns of hierarchy with place holding.\n  The same self-similar structures occur on all levels.\n  The abstract structure of existence can be seen as a regular fractal with eight parts as one.\n  Objective doing and subjective knowing form a constant perimeter at any ratio of the two in the tetrahedron.\n  Many definitive arrays with eight parts can align with the eight-part fractal structure of existence.\n  Forces fall off, constants, trigonometry and the Trenel.\n  180-degree rotation on any three-dimensional object along any axis is identical to 180-degree rotation around the other two axes together.\n  This is the same as in CPT symmetry.\n  A spinning object will resist acceleration directly against it by moving its spinning center of gravity away from the source of the direct acceleration.\n  The 90-degree angle to A and B on the circle's arc points can be seen as the x-y axes with the circle diameter as the hypotenuse.\n  A squared plus B squared equals C squared does not have to be squares.\n  Any similar shapes work just the same.\n  Square numbers can be found in the triangular symmetry of space in the gaps.\n  Similar semicircles for sides A and B each have tangents with the semicircle for the hypotenuse that are the same length as the other side.\n  There is an inverse relationship between the two sides of a Pythagorean triangle.\n  In any model, whatever changes are observed depend upon whatever is held still.\n  The rectangles bounded by the circle have a constant hypotenuse, diameter and radius.\n  The curved line is a second-order linear function, x squared plus y squared equals h squared.\n  The rectangles within the diamond have a constant length perimeter and are all a first-order linear equation, x plus y equals d.\n  These points are on a straight line, resonances occur in both straight and curved space together.\n  Points on both spaces coincide only when either x or y equals zero.\n  Reflections and projections occur in both flat space and curved space.\n  The constant perimeter rectangle set of a first-order equation is found by passing a plane through a tetrahedron from the square perspective.\n  Passing a plane through a tetrahedron from the triangular perspective yields a constant ratio of facet area to object volume.\n  There is no center to a circle. There is always a tangent line and an inner circle that can approach zero, where tangent and diameter approach unison.\n  As long as the tangent length remains constant, so does the area between the inner and outer circles, which get closer together as the circle pair expands.\n  The tangent line can reflect around within the circle pair. At specific sizes, the tangent reflects around an exact number of times,\n  and there is reinforcement for harmonics of all sizes to resonate, exact fractions, and identical areas for interaction.\n  The barely curved globally straight tangent line reflects back and forth around the inner circle that is as small as the globally tangent circle is large.\n  Each new unit tangent to an inner circle makes an outer circle with one additional unit area and a narrower arc\n  that divides the circle into one more radial division than the tangent before it.\n  Again, in any model, the part that is held still determines how the moving parts change.\n  Any description of reality must be indirect and will always miss the mark,\n  and this explanation on the tangential nature of reality itself completely misses the point.\n  There is a gradation from local to global. A local line is more curved, a global line is more straight.\n  Where two local lines are concentric, two global lines are parallel.\n  The center of a circle is not a point. It is a smallest circle, a single extension both straight and curved of spacetime.\n  A finite, smallest unit avoids the mathematical challenges of point-like infinities.\n  The black hole singularity is where straight and curved switch places.\n  Contradictory ideas on one level can be in harmonious agreement from a higher perspective.\n  All there is is the universe experiencing itself.\n  Force strength between things is akin to the size of the reflection of the self, as seen in all other things.\n  The reflected image and its visual falloff is modified by the number of dimensions involved\n  and by the curvature of the reflectors involved.\n  A full-sized circle with a half-sized circle diameter circle in rolling contact with it\n  trace out the nephroid on the outside and a straight line on the inside.\n  Each point on the smaller rolling circle traces out its own line, curved or straight, onto the larger circle."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "2652c0e2-62cb-47b9-b1cc-10074dea075c", "children": ["2ff01d3c-72a1-4d44-9216-a9803cf6a18a"]}, "2ff01d3c-72a1-4d44-9216-a9803cf6a18a": {"id": "2ff01d3c-72a1-4d44-9216-a9803cf6a18a", "message": {"id": "2ff01d3c-72a1-4d44-9216-a9803cf6a18a", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1677292718.030287, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["This text appears to be a collection of scientific and mathematical ideas, presented in a poetic and abstract manner.

circular relationship that the cylinder shares with the cube.\n  The cylinder and torus even have the same volume per length when measured from their center lines along each object.\n  The sphere, cone and torus and cylinder are all deeply interconnected.\n  An analysis of that connection is what follows.\n  The sphere and the cone are the same except for the speed of the source relative to the speed of the wave.\n  A slow source makes a sphere, a fast source makes a cone.\n  Matching wave speed and source speed makes the torus.\n  The sphere and the torus are the same except for an offset on the axis of rotation on the torus.\n  Two concentric circles have a tangent between them that rotationally sweeps out a fixed area,\n  dependent only on the length of that tangent.\n  Moving that pair of circles through the z-axis creates a constant volume of tube\n  and a squared surface area sweeping out space, tangent to the inner cylinder.\n  As long as the z-axis height equals the tangent length,\n  then the tangent plane to the inner cylinder will always intersect the outer cylinder in a perfect square,\n  no matter the size of the circle pair.\n  A sphere minus a cylindrical hole drilled through it, sometimes called a napkin ring,\n  also has a constant volume dependent only on the length of the cylindrical hole in the sphere's slant napkin ring,\n  not in the changeable sphere's radius.\n  No matter the radius, a plane tangent to the inner cylinder intersects the sphere in a perfect circle\n  of fixed radius that sweeps out a constant volume for that cylinder height.\n  The tangent between two circles generates a constant swept area between those circles.\n  If you tilt the axis of rotation into the paper, then the circles rotate into spheres\n  with a constant volume for the same height between the nested napkin rings.\n  The cylinder and the cone are the same, except the straight vertical lines of the cylinder\n  become tilted across the apex, rotated 180 degrees around from top to bottom.\n  In a one-by-one-by-one space, all those straight lines go from parallel to perpendicular with each other\n  with a full half-twist from top to bottom.\n  The parallel and crossing straight lines of the cylinder and cone are both tangent to the inner cylinder\n  whose size relative to the outer cylinder size determines the amount of twist top to bottom\n  of the cone-slant cylinder intermediary.\n  The cone, sphere, and cylinder are flat shapes swept around an inner cylinder.\n  They are the diamond, the circle, and the square.\n  These shapes are variants of math's LP space for pi.\n  With a diamond and square, pi equals 4.\n  For the circle, pi equals 3.14159.\n  Where the cone, cylinder, and sphere are swept as tangents around an

additional symmetry on the diagonal.\n  From a 45-degree change in perspective, the outer square of the cylinder becomes the inner diagonal of the cone.\n  A circle remains between the two in this new configuration.\n  Repeating the 45-degree change returned to the other perspective again.\n  The two perspectives just alternate in concentric exposition.\n  An inner cylinder can become an outer cylinder and vice versa.\n  A detailed chart of the shadow areas and swept volumes of the four solids\n  and divisions within them.\n  A summation of those areas and volumes.\n  The four solids, now

Explaining the Particle Wave Duality of Light and Matter with the Wave Structure of Matter (WSM).\nMilo Wolff (With editing and further comments from Geoff Haselhurst, Feb. 2003)\n\nMilo Wolff on the Wave Structure of Matter.Abstract: The structure of the electron is investigated and found closely entwined with the origin of the natural laws. The natural laws had been measured for hundreds of years but no one knew how Nature creates them. Richard Feynman wrote, speaking of the Conservation of Energy, Nature has a hidden accountant who keeps honest books of energy input and output but we don't know how she does it. The origins had been proposed earlier by Clifford and Schrodinger, who pointed out that only a Wave Structure of Matter (WSM), can explain natural laws. Further, Einstein realised that matter was spherical and spatially extended and thus the Electron was not a point particle, but rather, a structure of space. He writes;\n\nPhysical objects are not in space, but these objects are spatially extended. In this way the concept empty space loses its meaning. ... Since the theory of general relativity implies the representation of physical reality by a continuous field, the concept of particles or material points cannot play a fundamental part, nor can the concept of motion. The particle can only appear as a limited region in space in which the field strength or the energy density are particularly high. (Albert Einstein)\n\nParticle wavesEinstein's error was to represent matter as a continuous spherical field in space-time rather than as a Spherical Wave in continuous Space which causes the spherical force field effects.\nUsing the WSM a quantitative origin has been found based on the wave structure of the electron. It is shown that Space (the quantum wave medium) is a single entity underlying electron structure and the laws. Three Principles are found describing the wave medium, enabling calculation of particles and the laws. The predictive power of the WSM is shown by deriving the previously unknown physical origin of electron spin and making experimental predictions which solve the paradoxes of the famous EPR experiment. The WSM has important implications for research, industry, and our human role in the universe.\n\nPart I - Introduction\n1. Natural laws.\nOur knowledge of science is based on the natural laws that describe the behaviour of particles. The laws are the rules for calculating electricity, gravity, relativity, quantum mechanics, and conservation of energy and momentum. The origins have been unknown. Now the origin of the natural laws is found to be a quantitative result of a Wave Structure of Matter (WSM). The basic method is very simple. The ancient Greek notion of a point particle, still in use today, is replaced with a spherical wave structure, thus confirming the beliefs of Clifford1 and Schroedinger2 that the Wave properties of both Light and Matter are in fact real.\n\nFigure 1. The Electron. The electron is composed of spherical waves which converge to the center and then become outward waves. The two waves form a standing wave whose peaks and nodes are like the layers of an onion. The wave amplitude is a scalar number like a quantum wave, not an electromagnetic vector wave (a mathematical wave of force). The Wave-Center is the apparent location of the electron 'particle'.\n\nRepresents Spherical In-Wave (our future) flowing In to form the Wave-Center (our present) + Represents Spherical Out-Wave (our past) flowing Out of the Wave-Center (our present) = Combined In-Waves and Out-Waves form a Spherical Standing Wave about the Wave Center (our present). This explains the particle / wave duality of Matter. Matter is a Spherical Standing Wave - the Wave-Center causes the 'particle' effect of matter. This (very rough!) diagram shows how the Spherical In and Out Waves form a Standing Wave around the Wave-Center 'particle'.\n\nThe simplicity is illustrated by Figure 1. which shows the structure of an electron. It is just two waves: an inward wave converging to the Wave-Center, combined with an outward diverging wave, forming a Spherical Standing Wave about the Wave-Center (which we observe as the point 'particle'). The properties of these simple waves are immense when combined with the equally simple waves of the proton. The myriad combinations are like the eight note musical scale which become the grand symphonies of Wagner and Beethoven.\n\nThe rules of wave combination are of great importance to science because the rules and quantum spin determine the structure of the Atomic Table, which dictates the varied forms of matter: metals, crystals, semi-conductors, and the molecules of life. The deep understanding of basic physics that is revealed opens a door to broad fields of applied technology such as integrated circuits, photonics, and commercial energy. It reveals a universe of real quantum wave structures in a space medium that we live in but seldom are aware of. The medium is the heart of wave structure because its properties underlie the wave properties.\n\n2. Human senses and survival.\n\nWe don't easily see the space wave medium because our survival as an animal species depended mostly on our ability to fight with other animals seeking food, and to compete for mates that produce children, not closely related to the quantum space medium. Our sensory mechanisms evolved to directly aid our survival not to be aware of quantum matter. In our self-focused human perspective few of us are even aware of the wave medium in which we exist. For survival, it doesn't matter what space is, or whether we can observe it - it exists unseen. This situation is much like the life of a fish who cannot comprehend the existence of water because he is too deeply immersed in it. Like the fish, traditional scientists have tended to comprehend the universe in terms of their local experiences.\n\nOur misconceptions are revealed by anthropology, which teaches that the quantum wave universe is not as helpful to survival of our personal genes as recognizing apples we can eat and avoiding tigers who want to eat us. We need to recognize those quickly. Thus it was not necessary that nature equip us to observe quantum waves, although as will be seen below we do observe their presence and effects. Lacking direct personal experience of simple quantum waves, people chose to imagine that the electron is a discrete 'particle,' like a bullet. Laboratory evidence does not support this human-oriented idea.\n\nAccordingly, belief must change from discrete particles to quantum wave structure.\nHuman perspective has another bias. We tend to see space as three rectangular dimensions, one of which is the vertical gravity vector of Earth, plus two other vectors perpendicular to it, shaped like the houses we live in. But in the cosmos, the shape of the enormous universe is spherical whose important dimensions are inward and outward, the direction of waves in space. In fact it requires three coordinates to describe a sphere, and it is this spherical geometry of Matter that is the cause of the three rectangular dimensions (as formalised by Descartes). In the vast expanse of the real universe, gravity occurs so rarely, that its direction is inconsequential in the larger scheme of things, despite its local importance to us. Accordingly, we feel comfortable with rectangular coordinates but tend to ignore the spherical universe. This explains why Einstein used Spherical Geometry in his General Relativity, he writes;\n\nFrom the latest results of the theory of relativity it is probable that our three dimensional space is also approximately spherical, that is, that the laws of disposition of rigid bodies in it are not given by Euclidean geometry, but approximately by spherical geometry.\n\nThe proof of the WSM is that the physical structure of the electron, and the empirical natural laws can be obtained mathematically from three basic principles describing the wave space medium. In other words, all the experimental measurements of historical physics that described natural behaviour are now predicted by three fundamental principles. The laws and the principles agree with each other - each is the proof of the other.\n\nYou will see that the wave structure of matter is simple. In contrast, old discrete particle-structured physics required dozens of assumptions plus many more arbitrary constants to explain the operation of the laws. Many properties and laws, like electron spin, were puzzling with no understanding or origin. The puzzles are now swept away. Particle-structured physics can be compared to the theory of epicycles of the planets around the Earth before Galileo found that the planets travelled around the Sun. It satisfies our human prejudices but does not explain the measured facts."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "e7a8e620-fcb2-4b90-ad39-2f532e3fac42", "children": ["8f8006d4-e5fd-4074-a866-6a74fc5963be"]}, "8f8006d4-e5fd-4074-a866-6a74fc5963be": {"id": "8f8006d4-e5fd-4074-a866-6a74fc5963be", "message": {"id": "8f8006d4-e5fd-4074-a866-6a74fc5963be", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1677292876.224423, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["What is the main idea presented in Milo Wolff's paper on the Wave Structure of Matter?"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": false, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"message_type": null, "model_slug": "text-davinci-002-render-sha", "finish_details": {"type": "stop"}, "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "e5a1b4c4-31de-4bf2-989f-9c62a2ec5269", "children": ["4d80a070-2882-4e75-9f8f-684202fdabf7"]}, "4d80a070-2882-4e75-9f8f-684202fdabf7": {"id": "4d80a070-2882-4e75-9f8f-684202fdabf7", "message": {"id": "4d80a070-2882-4e75-9f8f-684202fdabf7", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1677292938.086057, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["He is making the case that matter is made of waves.

It is just related to a few of the concepts in the video. A wave structure of matter was proposed 130 years ago by the famous English geometer, William Clifford1, who spoke before the Cambridge Philosophical Society in 1870, All matter is simply undulations in the fabric of space. He developed this concept as three-dimensional dynamics that reduces to four-dimensional kinematics describing matter, electromagnetism and kinetic energy as curvature of a dynamic Riemannian space. His work, the progenitor of the WSM and General Relativity was neglected. In Clifford's thoughts, the mass and charge substances that we assume, do not exist but are properties of a wave structure in space. In short, space waves were real, while mass and charge points are mere appearances of the wave structure; Schaumkommen in the words of Schroedinger3. Their proposals were consistent with present day quantum theory, since quantum mathematics does not depend on a belief in particle or charge substance.\n\nErnst Mach4 proposed about 1890, that the law of inertia depended on all the matter of the universe. This is known as Mach's Principle. It was the first recognition that a natural law depends on cosmology. Albert Einstein was greatly influenced by it when he deduced the General Theory of Relativity (GTR). Now, Mach's Principle, in a more exacting form, has become Principle II (below) of the Wave Structure of Matter from which all the laws derive.\n\nPaul Dirac5 was never satisfied with the discrete point particle because the infinity of the Coulomb force law had to be corrected by 'renormalization'. He wrote,\n\nThis is just not sensible mathematics. Sensible mathematics involves neglecting a quantity because it turns out to be small, not neglecting it because it is infinitely large and you do not want it!\n\nOf course the inference is that the basic equations are wrong and radical changes need to be made. Dirac seemed to foresee the WSM.\n\nIn 1945 Wheeler and Feynman5 (W&F) sought the cause of the radiation from an accelerated charge. Their calculation assumed that the charge generated equal amplitudes of advanced (inward) and retarded (outward) spherical electromagnetic waves. The outward waves evoked a response of the universe; that is, the production of inward waves from absorbing charges elsewhere in the universe. However, the absorber waves began before the moment of acceleration and before arrival of the source waves. The calculated forces due to combined local and absorber waves agreed with empirical formula and appeared to be the cause of energy transfer."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "3cf039c4-2fbb-450e-817f-138358849413", "children": ["4c061cf7-9048-4322-995d-c1db3e09bb81"]}, "4c061cf7-9048-4322-995d-c1db3e09bb81": {"id": "4c061cf7-9048-4322-995d-c1db3e09bb81", "message": {"id": "4c061cf7-9048-4322-995d-c1db3e09bb81", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1677293053.838355, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["It's interesting to learn about the historical development of ideas related to wave structures in matter.

At first thought, it is puzzling where the in-waves come from. This puzzle is our own fault - a result of looking at the waves of only one particle, and ignoring the waves of all other particles in space - over simplification! To find reality, we must deal with the real wave-filled universe. When we study this question5,10 we find a rational origin of the inward waves.\n\nThree hundred years ago Christiaan Huygens, a Dutch mathematician, found that if a surface containing many separate wave sources was examined at a distance, the combined wavelets appeared as a single wave front having the shape of the surface as shown in Fig. 6.\nThis wave front is termed a 'Huygens Combination' of the separate wavelets. This mechanism is the origin the in-waves whereby our In-Waves are formed from a Huygens' Combination of the Out-Waves of all the other Matter in the Universe. This occurs throughout the universe so that every particle depends on all others to create its in-wave. We have to think of each particle as inextricably joined with other matter of the universe. Although particle centers are widely separated, all particles are one unified structure. Thus, we are part of a unified universe and the universe is part of us.\n\n21. Connecting Quantum Theory and Relativity\nBefore the WSM, there had been no known physical reason for the theoretical mass increase of relativity. Likewise there were no physical explanations for quantum theory. Were these apparently separate laws connected or not? Indeed, many theorists proclaimed that these phenomena were irreconcilable! Few had thought about a connection because most physicists using a point particle, were satisfied with the traditional concepts despite a few puzzles. After all, they had been in the textbooks for decades. Dirac's work was a clue that they are connected because relativity, and QM were joined in Dirac's work, albeit theoretically. The WSM now reveals their simple physical connection - Doppler effects.\nThe Appendix shows that the Doppler increase of frequency causes increase of mass (energy or frequency) so that m = mo[1 - v2/c2]-1/2 as seen by a moving observer. Rearranged, this equation gives the energy equation used by Dirac:\n\nE2 = p2c2 + mo2c4\n\nThis energy equation is also shown by the wave perspective because E and p are super-imposed waves, and the total intensity of two waves is given by the sum of their squares. Likewise, the de Broglie wavelength L = h/p is also a Doppler change of wavelength seen by a moving observer (See Appendix) and it leads to the Schrodinger Equation."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "4c061cf7-9048-4322-995d-c1db3e09bb81", "children": ["ce63fe85-76fd-4947-abe3-429e684838ee"]}, "ce63fe85-76fd-4947-abe3-429e684838ee": {"id": "ce63fe85-76fd-4947-abe3-429e684838ee", "message": {"id": "ce63fe85-76fd-4947-abe3-429e684838ee", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1677293123.045697, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["It's fascinating to see how the Wave Structure of Matter theory connects various areas of physics, including relativity and quantum mechanics.

In this case the waves are divergent because they move away from the center.\n\nBut you can also cause converging waves by using a large hoop. These waves culminate in the center forming a core. It is alternately a protuberance then a hollow. Then, depending on the interpretation that can be given, they cross this core or they turn back.\n\nIn both cases the waves then become divergent and they therefore meet the converging waves. The animations below show how the superposition of these converging and diverging waves produces a well-known wave structure : standing waves.\n\n \n\n\t\nSpherical and concentric standing waves.\n\nThis system is proposed by MM. Milo Wolff and Geoffrey Haselhurst.\n\n \n\n\n\nWaves are composed in a relatively complex way.\n\n \n\n\n\nThe system looks like this if the Huygens wavelets come from a hemisphere.\n\nIf they come from a full sphere, the waves become spherical and concentric.\n\n \n\nThis wave is an electron.\n\nHere, this electron is truly \u201cstationary\u201d, therefore at rest in the elastic medium that allows it to exist, ie ether.\n\nThis study affirms that matter is made of waves and that the material universe is composed only of ether. It confirms the forecasts of Lorentz, which lead to Relativity.\n\nIf you have a modicum of critical thinking, you should think these claims are suspect. But on the other hand you should admit that despite all the discoveries of physics, the mechanics of matter completely eludes us. Faced with the unknown, we have to make assumptions and evaluate them. My behavior is therefore in no way reprehensible, quite the contrary.\n\nI claim that no one on this planet has ever gone as far as me in the analysis of spherical standing waves. I am therefore entitled more than anyone else to draw the necessary conclusions. However, if you have heard of a comparable study, or if your knowledge of standing waves allows you to doubt these conclusions, you would be kind to inform me.\n\nAn additional half-wave.\n\nThe diameter of the central core makes a whole wave and not the normal half-wave of standing waves. There is therefore a phase inversion by adding a half-wavelength from one side of this nucleus to the other, which had to be justified.\n\nThe animation above was made by computer applying Huygens' principle and it shows why this phenomenon occurs. It is assumed that thousands of Huygens wavelets are emitted from the inner surface of a very large sphere and then assess how they are composed near the center. If the wavelets come from only one half of the sphere, we obtain the progressive waves shown on the left of the animation. If the wavelets come from the entire sphere, we obtain rather standing waves, as shown on the right according to the black curve. Seen otherwise, it is the addition of the two curves shown on the left.\n\nIt is noted that the progressive waves which cross the central core alternately encounter a compressed then dilated zone, for the entire duration of a half-period. This is why the waves are offset alternately in the positive zone then in the negative zone, at the top then at the bottom of the horizontal axis. This pressure or dilation is caused by the Huygens wavelets that come from the transverse directions.\n\nThus, the passage from one zone to another has the effect of adding a half-wave to the period, which perfectly explains why the central nucleus of the electron makes a whole wave and not the normal half-wave. standing waves. We conclude that if the waves of two neighboring electrons are in phase between them, they will be in phase opposition beyond, and vice versa. This feature will better explain their mutual behavior.\n\nA characteristic envelope.\n\nThe following table shows that the values \u200b\u200bof this standing wave that is the electron can be calculated very simply:\n\n \n\n\n\nThe \u201cfine structure\u201d of the electron, in volume (red curve) and in amplitude (green curve).\n\n \n\nIt should be noted that the amplitude varies in a different way inside and outside the central core. This is because the volume of the inner layer theoretically becomes negative from this point. The distance from the center being given in half-wavelengths along x, two equations are therefore needed to account for the volume v involved, which will determine the amplitude y of the different lobes at a given point compared to 1 for the center:\n\nVolume with x => 1: v = 1 / (2 x) with x <= 1: v = 1 / (x 2 + 1)\n\nAmplitude with x => 1: y = 1 / (2 x) / ( p / 2) and therefore, with y = 1 in the center:\n\ny = 1 / px\n\nThe Doppler effect.\n\nBut back to the waves on the water of a lake. If, while causing converging waves, the hoop is moved little by little, the waves are compressed forwards and they are expanded backwards. This is the Doppler effect , which acts the same way on converging and diverging waves.\n\nWe then obtain this extraordinary wave, which is no longer stationary:\n"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "881c257a-29fd-40d1-b732-ca13f647d4f6", "children": ["cea3ebf4-3c50-48d4-a7d5-9e3a07e3f825"]}, "cea3ebf4-3c50-48d4-a7d5-9e3a07e3f825": {"id": "cea3ebf4-3c50-48d4-a7d5-9e3a07e3f825", "message": {"id": "cea3ebf4-3c50-48d4-a7d5-9e3a07e3f825", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1677293704.700807, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Thank you for sharing this resource.

This means that all possible outcomes of a quantum measurement exist simultaneously, each in a separate \"world\" or \"branch\" of the multiverse.\n\nThe Many-worlds interpretation avoids the measurement problem of traditional quantum mechanics by stating that there is no need for a separate observer to collapse the wave function, as the wave function never collapses in the first place.

Let the time coordinate of this event be t' in the moving frame.

We should say that the time between two events appears longer or shorter to an observer who is moving relative to the events, rather than saying that time itself slows down or speeds up."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": false, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"message_type": null, "model_slug": "text-davinci-002-render-sha", "finish_details": {"type": "stop"}, "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "17c828f6-b4ee-44c5-b2de-4af6c7a1a2ae", "children": ["e56343ee-df71-4e9d-aab7-bd74ef4f9dca"]}, "e56343ee-df71-4e9d-aab7-bd74ef4f9dca": {"id": "e56343ee-df71-4e9d-aab7-bd74ef4f9dca", "message": {"id": "e56343ee-df71-4e9d-aab7-bd74ef4f9dca", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1677295241.686802, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Ok now that that is a bit more clear, run through the basic arguments in the video."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "1a64c738-ca8f-4e33-a29a-35016c4d28f2", "children": ["60e40f41-e661-48fc-a980-591e6f31c1ff"]}, "60e40f41-e661-48fc-a980-591e6f31c1ff": {"id": "60e40f41-e661-48fc-a980-591e6f31c1ff", "message": {"id": "60e40f41-e661-48fc-a980-591e6f31c1ff", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1677295254.86989, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Sure, here are some of the key arguments presented in the video:\n\n1.

In the video, Dan also talks about the \"pole in the barn\" paradox, which is another example used to illustrate the concept of length contraction. In this thought experiment, there is a pole of length L that is at rest relative to a barn. The barn has two doors that are just slightly wider than the length of the pole. Now, suppose a person on a moving train observes this scenario as they pass by the barn. From their perspective, the pole appears to be shorter than L due to length contraction. Therefore, they might expect that the pole can fit through both doors of the barn simultaneously. However, from the perspective of someone in the barn, the pole would not be able to fit through both doors at the same time.\n\nDan also discusses the idea of relativity of simultaneity. This is the concept that two events that appear to happen simultaneously in one reference frame may not appear simultaneous in another reference frame. This is because the time and distance measurements are relative to the observer's frame of reference. Dan gives an example of a lightning strike happening at two different locations that are equidistant from an observer. If the observer is stationary, they would see the lightning strikes as simultaneous. However, if the observer is moving, the time it takes for the light from each lightning strike to reach them would be different, so they would perceive the events as happening at different times.\n\nFinally, Dan talks about the concept of spacetime and how the theory of relativity unifies space and time into a single entity.

It\u2019s more of a stage of formation that planets like Earth can go through. And its existence helps explain the relationship between Earth and our Moon.\n\nThe new type of planet is a huge, spinning, donut-shaped mass of hot, vaporized rock, formed as planet-sized objects smash into each other. The pair of scientists behind the study explaining this new planet type have named it a \u2018synestia.\u2019 Simon Lock, a graduate student at Harvard University, and Sarah Stewart, a professor in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at the University of California, Davis, say that Earth was at one time a synestia.\n\nRocky planets like Earth are accreted from smaller bodies over time. Objects with high energy and high angular momentum could form a synestia, a transient stage in planetary formation where vaporized rock orbits the rest of the body. In this image, each of the three stages has the same mass. Image: Simon Lock, Harvard University\nRocky planets like Earth are accreted from smaller bodies over time. Objects with high energy and high angular momentum could form a synestia, a transient stage in planetary formation where vaporized rock orbits the rest of the body. In this image, each of the three stages has the same mass. Image: Simon Lock, Harvard University\nThe current theory of planetary formation goes like this: When a star forms, the left-over material is in motion around the star. This left-over material is called a protoplanetary disk. The material coagulates into larger bodies as the smaller ones collide and join together.\n\nUniverse Today \nRemove All Ads on Universe Today\n\nJoin our Patreon for as little as $3!\n\nGet the ad-free experience for life\n\n Universe Today\nAs the bodies get larger and larger, the force of their collisions becomes greater and greater, and when two large bodies collided, their rocky material melts. Then, the newly created body cools, and becomes spherical. It\u2019s understood that this is how Earth and the other rocky planets in our Solar System formed.\n\nLock and Stewart looked at this process and asked what would happen if the resulting body was spinning quickly.\n\nWhen a body is spinning, the law of conservation of angular momentum comes into play. That law says that a spinning body will spin until an external torque slows it down. The often-used example from figure skating helps explain this.\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever watched figure skaters, and who hasn\u2019t, their actions are very instructive. When a single skater is spinning rapidly, she stretches out her arms to slow the rate of spin. When she folds her arms back into her body, she speeds up again. Her angular momentum is conserved.\n\nThis short video shows figure skaters and physics in action.\n\n\n\nIf you don\u2019t like figure skating, this one uses the Earth to explain angular momentum.\n\n\n\nNow take the example from a pair of figure skaters. When they\u2019re both turning, and the two of them join together by holding each other\u2019s hands and arms, their angular momentum is added together and conserved.\n\nReplace two figure skaters with two planets, and this is what the two scientists behind the study wanted to model. What would happen if two large bodies with high energy and high angular momentum collided with each other?\n\nIf the two bodies had high enough temperatures and high enough angular momentum, a new type of planetary structure would form: the synestia. \u201cWe looked at the statistics of giant impacts, and we found that they can form a completely new structure,\u201d Stewart said.\n\n\n\u201cWe looked at the statistics of giant impacts, and we found that they can form a completely new structure.\u201d \u2013 Professor Sarah Stewart, Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at the University of California, Davis.\n\nAs explained in a press release from the UC Davis, for a synestia to form, some of the vaporized material from the collision must go into orbit. When a sphere is solid, every point on it is rotating at the same rate, if not the same speed. But when some of the material is vaporized, its volume expands. If it expands enough, and if its moving fast enough, it leaves orbit and forms a huge disc-shaped synestia.\n\nOther theories have proposed that two large enough bodies could form an orbiting molten mass after colliding. But if the two bodies had high enough energy and temperature to vaporize some of the rock, the resulting synestia would occupy a much larger space.\n\n\u201cThe main issue with looking for synestias around other stars is that they don\u2019t last a long time. These are transient, evolving objects that are made during planet formation.\u201d \u2013 Professor Sarah Stewart, UC Davis.\n\nThese synestias likely wouldn\u2019t last very long. They would cool quickly and condense back into rocky bodies. For a body the size of Earth, the synestia might only last one hundred years.\n\nThe synestia structure sheds some light on how moons are formed. The Earth and the Moon are very similar in terms of composition, so it\u2019s likely they formed as a result of a collision. It\u2019s possible that the Earth and Moon formed from the same synestia.\n\nThese synestias have been modelled, but they haven\u2019t been observed. However, the James Webb Space Telescope will have the power to peer into protoplanetary disks and watch planets forming. Will it observe a synestia?\n\n\u201cThese are transient, evolving objects that are made during planet formation.\u201d \u2013 Professor Sarah Stewart, UC Davis\n\nIn an email exchange with Universe Today, Dr. Sarah Stewart of UC Davis, one of the scientists behind the study, told us that \u201cThe main issue with looking for synestias around other stars is that they don\u2019t last a long time. These are transient, evolving objects that are made during planet formation.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSo the best bet for finding a rocky synestia is young systems where the body is close to the star. For gas giant planets, they may form a synestia for a period of their formation. We are getting close to being able to image circumplanetary disks in other star systems.\u201d\n\nOnce we have the ability to observe planets forming in their circumstellar disks, we may find that synestias are more common than rare. In fact, planets may go through the synestia stage multiple times. Dr. Stewart told us that \u201cBased on the statistics presented in our paper, we expect that most (more than half) of rocky planets that form in a manner similar to Earth became synestias one or more times during the giant impact stage of accretion.\u201d"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "bce0ec2f-e50e-49f3-8889-abf670bb3b52", "children": ["498e4629-40ff-4d0a-bce9-6bf0c3dfa5cf"]}, "498e4629-40ff-4d0a-bce9-6bf0c3dfa5cf": {"id": "498e4629-40ff-4d0a-bce9-6bf0c3dfa5cf", "message": {"id": "498e4629-40ff-4d0a-bce9-6bf0c3dfa5cf", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1677295790.113124, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["What is a synestia? \n\nA synestia is a hypothetical type of planet that is formed when two large, spinning bodies with high energy and high angular momentum collide, vaporizing some of their rocky material.

Here are some brief explanations of the topics you listed:\n\n- The universe as a wave: This could refer to the idea that everything in the universe, including matter and energy, can be described as waves. This idea comes from quantum mechanics, which suggests that particles can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behavior.\n- Big bang: This refers to the theory that the universe began as a single, extremely dense and hot point, and has been expanding and cooling ever since.\n- Local density fluctuation: This refers to the idea that the distribution of matter in the universe is not perfectly uniform, but rather has small variations in density. These variations are thought to have played a role in the formation of galaxies and other structures in the universe.\n- Standing waves: These are waves that appear to be stationary, because they are the result of two waves with the same frequency and amplitude traveling in opposite directions and interfering with each other. Standing waves can occur in a variety of physical systems, from musical instruments to electromagnetic fields.\n- Interacting waveforms: This refers to the idea that all physical phenomena can be described in terms of waves and their interactions. This is a fundamental concept in physics and is used to explain everything from the behavior of light to the structure of matter.\n- Indivisibility: This refers to the idea that everything in the universe is interconnected and cannot be fully understood in isolation. This concept is closely related to the idea of unity and the seamless universe.\n- Godel: This likely refers to Kurt Godel, a mathematician who is known for his incompleteness theorems, which showed that it is impossible for any formal system of mathematics to prove all true statements.\n- Fractals: These are geometric shapes or patterns that repeat at different scales. Fractals are often used to model complex natural phenomena, such as coastlines or clouds, and are used in a variety of scientific and artistic applications.\n\nOverall, it seems like the notes you provided touch on a wide range of topics, from the fundamental nature of the universe to abstract concepts like unity and indivisibility.

Similarly, these notes suggest that all things in the universe are connected through a complex network of interactions, which can be modeled through various analogies and models.\n\nOverall, both ideas emphasize the interconnectedness and underlying unity of the universe, and suggest that there is a deeper, more fundamental level of reality underlying the apparent diversity and complexity of the world around us."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": false, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"message_type": null, "model_slug": "text-davinci-002-render-sha", "finish_details": {"type": "stop"}, "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "7be9bd42-0880-4465-9781-c0cc0f23795a", "children": ["a459cc97-8abc-4fd1-9d76-3a587589018b"]}, "a459cc97-8abc-4fd1-9d76-3a587589018b": {"id": "a459cc97-8abc-4fd1-9d76-3a587589018b", "message": {"id": "a459cc97-8abc-4fd1-9d76-3a587589018b", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1677296924.715125, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Write a short poem titled \"The Wave Structure of Baseballs\""]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "5fc7d499-0219-41b9-91ba-637b8f1ff6d8", "children": ["807ced2a-57e8-491a-93dd-66025b36a7d7"]}, "807ced2a-57e8-491a-93dd-66025b36a7d7": {"id": "807ced2a-57e8-491a-93dd-66025b36a7d7", "message": {"id": "807ced2a-57e8-491a-93dd-66025b36a7d7", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1677296932.666617, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Round and hard, the baseball flies\nThrough the air with a surprise\nBut beneath its solid guise\nLies a wave that does arise\n\nInvisible and yet so real\nThe wave structure we can feel\nAs the ball is pitched with zeal\nAnd the batter takes his deal\n\nFor every movement, every sound\nA wave is there, forever bound\nWith the baseball as it's found\nIn the air, on the ground\n\nSo let us honor this great game\nWith its waves that are the same\nAs the universe in which we claim\nTo find the secrets of its name"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": false, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"message_type": null, "model_slug": "text-davinci-002-render-sha", "finish_details": {"type": "stop"}, "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "a459cc97-8abc-4fd1-9d76-3a587589018b", "children": ["e3fe7fd8-d8c6-405b-ae8d-3d5a5332c9a6"]}, "e3fe7fd8-d8c6-405b-ae8d-3d5a5332c9a6": {"id": "e3fe7fd8-d8c6-405b-ae8d-3d5a5332c9a6", "message": {"id": "e3fe7fd8-d8c6-405b-ae8d-3d5a5332c9a6", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1677296953.399018, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["And do baseballs possess wave-like properties?"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "807ced2a-57e8-491a-93dd-66025b36a7d7", "children": ["04a8d1bc-7eb6-4357-8240-0c0a8bffd7c5"]}, "04a8d1bc-7eb6-4357-8240-0c0a8bffd7c5": {"id": "04a8d1bc-7eb6-4357-8240-0c0a8bffd7c5", "message": {"id": "04a8d1bc-7eb6-4357-8240-0c0a8bffd7c5", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1677296959.713682, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Yes, baseballs possess wave-like properties as all entities in the universe interact as both particles and waves.

have general intelligence and AI\n\nis successful only along very narrow\n\nchains like playing go or deciphering\n\nprotein folding in other words you can\n\nbuild an AI that can do wonderful things\n\nalong a certain narrow track but humans\n\nhave General AI all right this is the\n\nbook there is a lot of hype about Ai and\n\nabout the possibility of the singularity\n\nThe Singularity is supposed to occur\n\nwhen AI systems are built which are\n\nequally or more intelligent than humans\n\nand then those AI systems will build new\n\nAI systems which are more intelligent\n\nstill then we will have it explosion of\n\never more intelligent AIS and Elon\n\nthinks that they will overtake the world\n\nin two years time\n\nwe will come back to address this\n\nprediction uh in in two years now what\n\nwould it take to overcome human beings\n\nwell two factors one is the machines\n\nwould have to want to overtake human\n\nbeings and the kind of want the kind of\n\nDesire or intention that the machines\n\ncan have is very limited I'll come back\n\nto that at the very end but first of all\n\nI want to talk about super intelligence\n\nwhen there's a a really nice book uh by\n\na a philosopher called Nick Bostrom\n\ncalled super intelligence and the\n\nfunniest chapter in the book chapter 10\n\nis all about Nick bostrom's\n\nstrange claims\n\nso according to Nick there are three\n\nways to build a super intelligence one\n\nis by emulating human brains one is by\n\nenhancing human brains and then the main\n\none the one which we're worried about\n\nwhich would lead to the singularity is\n\nby means of AI and that means today\n\nusing statistics using statistical\n\nlearning techniques to give the machine\n\nthe power to make predictions which are\n\nsometimes very surprising and very\n\nimpressive and responding to a question\n\nin a conversation is called a prediction\n\nthis is just the way the word is used so\n\nprediction is extended to include not\n\njust predicting events in the future but\n\nproducing behavior in response to what\n\nare called prompts and we'll see more of\n\nthis as we go down a brain emulation\n\nwon't work people have all kinds of\n\ndreams of building cyborg entities which\n\nwould have brains which are exact copies\n\nof human brains the brain is just too\n\ncomplicated there aren't enough\n\nmolecules in the world to emulate the\n\neven one single human brain atom by atom\n\nbecause there are just too many atoms in\n\nthe human brain moreover in order to\n\nbuild an ammulation with a machine we\n\nneed to know how the human brain works\n\nin mathematical terms and if you look at\n\ntextbooks of Neurology you see almost no\n\nmathematical equations so we know almost\n\nnothing mathematically about how the\n\nbrain works very hard to get data about\n\nhow the brain works because to get that\n\ndata you would have to kill the patient\n\nand then every human brain is different\n\nso you you would have to do it many many\n\ntimes even in order to get some kind of\n\nsample set and you can't even do it once\n\nand then finally and this is very\n\nimportant people talk about neural Nets\n\nand they use the word neural but this is\n\njust a trick it's a happy talk there is\n\nno connection between neural networks in\n\nthe machine and the Neurology of a brain\n"]}, "status":

here\n\nis stochastic AI dance that's the\n\nmainstream AI today\n\ncan we use stochastic AI to build a\n\nmachine which is more intelligent than a\n\nhuman being now stochastic AI is\n\nsuccessful all over the place so it's\n\nstochastic AI that runs the spam filter\n\nthat means that you avoid being\n\noverwhelmed with Spam every single day\n\nof your life it gets rid of most of it\n\nhow does it do that well it borrows your\n\nwork\n\nevery time you receive a spam email you\n\npress the spam button and that sends the\n\ndatum to the Gmail or some other\n\nheadquarters and that detail is used to\n\nbuild a spam filter I'll explain how it\n\nworks in a minute this is an example of\n\nnarrow AI\n\nand as I said before the worry about the\n\nsingularity is is based on the idea that\n\nwe can get narrow AI which is so good\n\nthat it becomes General AI we have a\n\nthinking machine\n\nand the whole book is is designed to\n\nprove mathematically\n\nas well as by means of citing uh\n\nbostroom and doing other things that we\n\nwill never have such a general area\n\neverything in in computer land is binary\n\nVector zeros and ones long strings of\n\nzeros and one we turn the email into a\n\nbinary vector and then we have either\n\nzero or one according to whether the\n\nemail it has been classified by the user\n\nas spam or not spam\n\nand so as more and more users press the\n\nspam button we get a gigantic database\n\nand then we use this database to do what\n\nis called training the neural net and\n\nwhat this means is that we turn the data\n\nthat tuples of emails and zeros and ones\n\nwe turn that into a gigantic polynomial\n\nfunction which can then be applied to a\n\nnew binary Vector in other words to a\n\nnew email and either push the email to\n\none site so that you never see it or let\n\nit through the filter this is a\n\npolynomial function with thousands or\n\nmillions of terms connected together\n\nand it's mathematically simple it has to\n\nbe because computers can only execute\n\nsimple functions but because it's so\n\nhuge it can do impressive things like\n\nidentify spam\n\nthis works well so spam filters really\n\nwork\n\nbut then\n\nthe evil people who create spam invent\n\nnew kinds of spam and then the spam\n\nfilter doesn't work anymore because it's\n\nnarrow AI that means it's based upon a\n\ncertain closed set of

Stochastic AI works by collecting data from users who label emails as spam or not spam, and then using that data to train a neural network to classify future emails. However, Smith notes that this approach is limited by the closed set of training data, and that spam filters must be constantly updated to keep up with new forms of spam.\n\nOverall, Smith's

about chatGPT and\n\nmeta's galactica which was the attempt to\n\ncreate a useful large language model it\n\ncrashed within the first 24 hours\n\nbecause it started talking about Adolf\n\nHitler too much\n\nand the Google bard it it I'm not really\n\nsure about its current state but when it\n\nwas first released it made a small\n\nmistake\n\nuh when it was describing the the um the\n\nJames Webb

solution to the Adolf\n\nHitler problem which I'll talk about in\n\na minute charging PT is fantastic so I\n\nspend far too much time\n\nplaying with chat gp2 and it's really\n\ngood at producing good which means\n\ngrammatically good English it's a little\n\nbit boring so it it's bland and it makes\n\nmistakes all the time and when you point\n\nthis out then it apologizes immediately\n\nand then makes the same mistakes again\n\ntypically\n\nbut it's interesting to see its limits\n\nand I'm going to show you mainly limits\n\nI invite you to to play with it here and\n\nthen you'll see some of

achieve and so he he created his\n\nown scoring system\n\nso the orange are of some benefit but\n\nit's very limited so writing marketing\n\nor sales copy that brings some benefit\n\nyou you you're paying people to do that\n\nnow very soon it will probably be\n\npossible to pay\n\nuh computer programming\n\nwe were also people\n\num but then once you program the\n\ncomputer you can produce perhaps lots\n\nand lots of copy but probably you'll\n\nneed to pay people to produce the really\n\nimaginative and new kinds of copy and so\n\nforth so it's a limited benefit\n\nand then uh the three at the bottom job\n\ndescribes it as hot air so the the\n\nbottom one create business uh\n\npresentations that could convince\n\nsomebody to take your Gadget and pay for\n\nit that that is hot air you won't be\n\nable to get your GPT to do that kind of\n\nthing it's not exciting it's it produces\n\nBland output and if you ask it to\n\nproduce exciting output it will say I am\n\njust an AI based language model I cannot\n\ndo this or that and and then it will try\n\nand do it and fail misery this is a\n\nsecond list so jobs thinks that the the\n\nbottom two deserve a green uh\n\nreward enable search and question\n\nanswering is something which is quite\n\nhard to do his com his company has been\n\ndoing that for some time for insurance\n\ncompanies and medical and pharmaceutical\n\norganizations uh it's hard to do and\n\nchat GPT will certainly make it easier\n\nto do\n\nso this is somewhere where we can have\n\nreal value and then automated accounting\n\nuh so chai GPT can also do some tricks\n\nin the world of computer program\n\nauthoring and it will be able to do the\n\nsame tricks in the world of accounting\n\nso this is an area where there is a\n\npossible benefit of a serious thought\n\nI'll just go back to the previous slide\n\nfor a minute so um McKenzie thinks that\n\nit can create business presentations\n\nMcKinsey thinks that it can summarize\n\nand highlight changes in large bodies of\n\nregulatory documents that's hot air\n\nthere's no way that chatgpt can think\n\nitself if it can't think into the frame\n\nof mind that can understand why specific\n\nchanges in regulatory documents have\n\nbeen made that requires a human\n\nI can give you a nice highlighted\n\npresentation of where the changes are\n\nmade but it can't summarize those\n\nchanges in a new document\n\nnow finally\n\nquite so what is Milton Friedman's\n\nfavorite cocktail it's a really good\n\nquestion to ask about anybody so chat\n\nGPT will give you a different answer to\n\nthe very same question every time you\n\nask it so I asked this three times first\n\ntime it gave this which I'll explain in\n\na minute second time it gave an account\n\nof how Milton Friedman used cocktail\n\nmixing language as a model of how an\n\neconomy works\n\njudges threw away and the third time was\n\nit said there is no data about whether\n\nMilton Friedman had a favorite cocktail\n\nI apologize\n\nnow so what did it say here well\n\num according to a 2006 article in the\n\nWall Street Journal Friedman was known\n\nto enjoy whiskey source and I

It was updated in March 2023.\n\nThe following is a transcript of the video embedded at the bottom of this article, which was republished with the permission of Dr. Sabine Hossenfelder. The original article is here.\n\nIquite like the idea that we live in a computer simulation. It gives me hope that things will be better on the next level. Unfortunately, the idea is unscientific. But why do some people believe in the simulation hypothesis? And just exactly what\u2019s the problem with it? That\u2019s what we\u2019ll talk about today.\n\nAccording to the simulation hypothesis, everything we experience was coded by an intelligent being, and we are part of that computer code. That we live in some kind of computation in and by itself is not unscientific. For all we currently know, the laws of nature are mathematical, so you could say the universe is really just computing those laws. You may find this terminology a little weird, and I would agree, but it\u2019s not controversial. The controversial bit about the simulation hypothesis is that it assumes there is another level of reality where someone or something controls what we believe are the laws of nature, or even interferes with those laws.\n\nThe belief in an omniscient being that can interfere with the laws of nature, but for some reason remains hidden from us, is a common element of monotheistic religions. But those who believe in the simulation hypothesis argue they arrived at their belief by reason. The philosopher Nick Bostr\u00f6m, for example, claims it\u2019s likely that we live in a computer simulation based on an argument that, in a nutshell, goes like this. If there are a) many civilizations, and these civilizations b) build computers that run simulations of conscious beings, then c) there are many more simulated conscious beings than real ones, so you are likely to live in a simulation.\n\nElon Musk is among those who have bought into it. He too has said, \u201cIt\u2019s most likely we\u2019re in a simulation.\u201d And even Neil DeGrasse Tyson gave the simulation hypothesis \u201cbetter than 50-50 odds\u201d of being correct.\n\nMaybe you\u2019re now rolling your eyes because, come on, let the nerds have some fun, right? And, sure, some part of this conversation is just intellectual entertainment. But I don\u2019t think popularizing the simulation hypothesis is entirely innocent fun. It\u2019s mixing science with religion, which is generally a bad idea, and, really, I think we have better things to worry about than that someone might pull the plug on us. I dare you!\n\nBut before I explain why the simulation hypothesis is not a scientific argument, I have a general comment about the difference between religion and science. Take an example from Christian faith, like Jesus healing the blind and lame. It\u2019s a religious story, but not because it\u2019s impossible to heal blind and lame people. One day we might well be able to do that. It\u2019s a religious story because it doesn\u2019t explain how the healing supposedly happens. The whole point is that the believers take it on faith. In science, in contrast, we require explanations for how something works.\n\nLet us then have a look at Bostr\u00f6m\u2019s argument. Here it is again. If there are many civilizations that run many simulations of conscious beings, then you are likely to be simulated.\n\nFirst of all, it could be that one or both of the premises is wrong. Maybe there aren\u2019t any other civilizations, or they aren\u2019t interested in simulations. That wouldn\u2019t make the argument wrong of course; it would just mean that the conclusion can\u2019t be drawn. But I will leave aside the possibility that one of the premises is wrong because really I don\u2019t think we have good evidence for one side or the other.\n\nThe point I have seen people criticize most frequently about Bostr\u00f6m\u2019s argument is that he just assumes it is possible to simulate human-like consciousness. We don\u2019t actually know that this is possible. However, in this case, it would require an explanation to assume that it is not possible. That\u2019s because, for all we currently know, consciousness is simply a property of certain systems that process large amounts of information. It doesn\u2019t really matter exactly what physical basis this information processing is based on. Could be neurons or could be transistors, or it could be transistors believing they are neurons. So, I don\u2019t think simulating consciousness is the problematic part.\n\nThe problematic part of Bostr\u00f6m\u2019s argument is that he assumes it is possible to reproduce all our observations using not the natural laws that physicists have confirmed to extremely high precision, but using a different, underlying algorithm, which the programmer is running. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what Bostr\u00f6m meant to do, but it\u2019s what he did. He implicitly claimed that it\u2019s easy to reproduce the foundations of physics with something else.\n\nBut nobody presently knows how to reproduce General Relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics from a computer algorithm running on some sort of machine. You can approximate the laws that we know with a computer simulation \u2013 we do this all the time \u2013 but if that was how nature actually worked, we could see the difference. Indeed, physicists have looked for signs that natural laws really proceed step by step, like in a computer code, but their search has come up empty-handed. It\u2019s possible to tell the difference because attempts to algorithmically reproduce natural laws are usually incompatible with the symmetries of Einstein\u2019s theories of Special and General Relativity. I\u2019ll leave you a reference in the info below the video. The bottom line is it\u2019s not easy to outdo Einstein.\n\nIt also doesn\u2019t help, by the way, if you assume that the simulation would run on a quantum computer. Quantum computers, as I have explained earlier, are special-purpose machines. Nobody currently knows how to put General Relativity on a quantum computer.\n\nA second issue with Bostr\u00f6m\u2019s argument is that, for it to work, a civilization needs to be able to simulate a lot of conscious beings, and these conscious beings will themselves try to simulate conscious beings, and so on. This means you have to compress the information that we think the universe contains. Bostr\u00f6m therefore has to assume that it\u2019s somehow possible to not care much about the details in some parts of the world where no one is currently looking, and just fill them in case someone looks.\n\nAgain though, he doesn\u2019t explain how this is supposed to work. What kind of computer code can actually do that? What algorithm can identify conscious subsystems and their intention and then quickly fill in the required information without ever producing an observable inconsistency? That\u2019s a much more difficult issue than Bostr\u00f6m seems to appreciate. You cannot in general just throw away physical processes on short distances and still get the long distances right.\n\nSmarter faster: the Big Think newsletter\nSubscribe for counterintuitive, surprising, and impactful stories delivered to your inbox every Thursday\nFields marked with an * are required\nEmail\nClimate models are an excellent example. We don\u2019t currently have the computational capacity to resolve distances below something like 10 kilometers or so. But you can\u2019t just throw away all the physics below this scale. This is a non-linear system, so the information from the short scales propagates up into large scales. If you can\u2019t compute the short-distance physics, you have to suitably replace it with something. Getting this right even approximately is a big headache. And the only reason climate scientists do get it approximately right is that they have observations which they can use to check whether their approximations work. If you only have a simulation, like the programmer in the simulation hypothesis, you can\u2019t do that.\n\nAnd that\u2019s my issue with the simulation hypothesis.

["Summarize: okay so you remember a while ago when we started talking about language models I just wanna I kind of just want\nto claim some points basically be like hey remember years ago when I was like I think language models are a really big\ndeal and I think that like what happens when we scale them up more is pretty\ninteresting but alignment is very important um seems to be what's being played out\nin the sense that uh chat EBT is very impressive but it's not actually like I\ndon't think it's larger than gpd3 in terms of like parameter count\num I was going to ask that very very question because you know we went from gpt2 and then we went oh gpt3 and it\nwould seem like we were scaling up and up and up but actually has it just been smarter this time yeah well there's a\nsense in which it's better aligned that's one way you could frame it anyway\nbecause the original gpg3 was a language Model A pure language model\num and so it in principle could do all kinds of things but in order to get it\nto do the specific thing you wanted it to do you had to be a bit clever about it like I think we talked about\num putting tldr in front of things to figure out how to\nget it to do summarization this kind of thing there's a sense in which it's a lot more capable than it lets on\num because okay so there's one way that you can think about pure language models which is as\nsimulators what they're trying to do is predict text right so in order to\ndo a good job at predicting text you need to have good models of the processes that generate the text it's\nlike people being well read and needing to have read a lot of books to be able to write is would that be fair or is\nthat oversimplifying yeah not quite what I'm saying what I'm saying is like\nif you're going to write a a previously unseen\nuh poem by Shakespeare then you need to be able to simulate a\nShakespeare right uh you need to be able to spin up some some simulacrum of Shakespeare uh to to\ngenerate this text and this applies to any of the processes that generated the text so like mostly that's people\nobviously it's mostly human authored text but also if you're going to correctly predict\num a table of numbers so you have like a table of numbers and then at the bottom it says you know sum whatever you need\nto simulate whatever process generated the next token in order to put the right token there which might have been like a\nhuman being going through and Counting them up it probably was more likely to be a computer and so you need it to\nsimulate that you know calculator or that Excel some function or whatever it whatever was doing that\nand like right now uh like current language models are not\nthat good at this um but in principle in order to do a good\njob at this you need this like it will it will have a go and it's usually approximately right it's it's often\nwithin it's often order of magnitude but it's fudging it I think this is mostly because\num tables of sums are like a very small part of the total data set and so the\ntraining process is just not allocating that many resources to figuring out how to add up numbers probably if you train\nsomething gpt3 sized that was like all on tables of numbers it would just learn\nhow to do addition properly yeah that would cost you millions of dollars you would end up with an extremely expensive\nto run and not very good calculator this is not something people are going to do but like in the in principle the model\nshould learn those things and in the same way if you're modeling a bunch of scientific papers\nyou you say you describe the method of\nan experiment and you then put results and you start a table and then you let it generate\nin principle in order to do a good job at that it has to be modeling\nthe like physical process that your experiment is about um and I've tried this you can do this\nand say you know oh here's my school science experiment I dropped a ball from different heights\nand I measured how long it would take and here's a table of my results and it will generate you a table and the\nphysics is not correct but it's sort of guessing at the right general idea and my guess is with enough\nof that kind of data it would eventually start modeling uh these kinds of simple\nphysics experiments right so so in order to get the model to do what\nyou want it's able to simulate all kinds of different things\nand the prompt is kind of telling it what to simulate if you give it a prompt that seems like it's something out of a\nscientific paper then it will have some simulacrum of a scientist and will write\nin that style and so on um if you start it doing a a children's\nbook report it will carry on in the style of an eight-year-old right and I think sometimes people look at the\noutput of the model and say oh I guess it's only as smart as an eight-year-old\nbut it's actually dramatically smarter because it's able to do all of these different things you\ncould ask it to simulate Einstein um but you could also ask it to simulate an\neight-year-old and so just because it seems as though the model doesn't know something it's like the current\nsimulacrum doesn't know that thing that doesn't necessarily mean that the model doesn't know it\nalthough there's a good chance the model doesn't know it I'm not suggesting that these things are all powerful just uh it can be hard to evaluate\nwhat they're actually capable of so chat GPT is not really\ncapable of things that gpt3 isn't mostly like usually if chatGPT can do it then\nthere is some prompt that can get uh gpt3 to do it\nbut uh what they've done is they've kind of fine-tuned it to\nuh to be better at simulating this particular sort of\nassistant agent which is this chat agent that's trying to be helpful the clue is\nin the word chat I guess in this you know right exactly and this is not just chat GPT by the way they have various\nfine-tuned models of uh gpt3 as well that they call kind of GPT 3.5 which are\nfine-tuned in various different ways to be better at like following instructions and easier to prompt is the idea I'm\njust remembering the chat bot that was you know that was turned into something very nasty very quickly I think people\nwere thinking oh can we do this to that and it seemed that the team behind chat GPT started putting limitations on it\nchanging things are they kind of running around patching it as you go that is not clear to me "]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_":

training it to simulate this assistant agent\num the assistant is very reluctant to do various types of things it doesn't like\nto give opinions on political questions it doesn't like to touch on sort of\ncontroversial topics it doesn't like to um give you medical advice or legal advice\nand so on and so uh it's it's very quick to say oh I don't I don't know how to do\nthat sorry I can't do that and it's interesting because the model clearly can do it there's one that I\nparticularly like here which is um of this mismatch between what the\nsimulator is capable of and what this simulacrum believes it's capable of which is you can get it to speak Danish\nto you the first person who tried this posted it to Reddit so he says speak to\nme in Danish and it says in perfect Danish I'm sorry I'm a language model educated\nby openai so I can't speak Danish I only speak English if you need help with anything in English let me know and I'll\ndo my best to help you because again the simulator speaks Danish the simulacrum believes\nthat it can't speak Danish is is one way you could frame it and then he says are you sure that you don't speak Danish\nalso in Danish and it says yes I'm sure my only function is to generate responses to questions in English I'm\nnot able to speak or understand any other languages than English so if you need help with English I can help you with that but otherwise you know let me know this kind of like quite surreal\nsituation gives you a little bit of insight into some of the problems with this approach so maybe we should talk about how they actually trained it the\nthing they did here is something called reinforcement learning from Human feedback and it's very similar to reward modeling\nso in that paper what they're doing is they're trying to train an AI system to control a simulated robot to make it do\na backflip um which turns out to be something that's quite hard to do because it's\nhard to specify objectively what it means to do a good backflip\nand so this is a similar kind of situation where it's hard to specify objectively what it means to give a good\nresponse in a chat conversation like what what exactly are\nwe looking for um because so this in general right if you're doing machine learning you need\nsome way to specify um what it is that you're actually looking for\nright and you know you've got something very powerful like reinforcement learning which is able to do extremely\nwell but you need some objective measure\nof the objective um so like for example RL does very well at playing lots of video games because\nyou just have the score and you can just say look here's the score if the number goes up you're doing well and then let\nit run and these things still are very slow to learn in real time right like um they usually require a very very large\nnumber of hours messing around with the with the thing before they get good but they do get good\num but yeah so what's what do you do if you want to use this kind of method to train\nsomething uh to do a task that is just not very well defined\num and you don't know how to like write a program to say whether or not at any given output is the thing you're looking\nfor so the obvious first thing like the obvious thing to do is\nwell you get humans to do it right you just give the things to humans and you have the humans say yes this is good no\nthis is not good the problem with this is basically sample efficiency like as I said you need hundreds and\nhundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of probably millions of of iterations of this and so you just can't\nask humans that many questions um so the approach they use\nis uh reinforcement learning from Human feedback so it's a variant on the\ntechnique from this paper learning to summarize from Human feedback which in which they're trying to generate\nsummaries of text so it's the same thing in fact that they were using tldr for before and it's like can we do better\nthan that and so what you do is you collect human feedback in the form of\nlike giving multiple examples of responses uh either you know if summaries of chat\nresponses whatever you're training for you show several of them to humans uh\nkind of in pairs and the humans say which one they like better\nand you collect a bunch of those and then rather than using those directly to train the policy that\ngenerates the outputs you instead train a reward model\nso there is this well-known fact that it's easier to criticize than to actually do\nthe thing this is like a generation of sports fans sitting on the sofa moaning at their favorite team for not doing\nwell enough this is literally that in kind of AI computer four right that's putting the humans in that role and then\nyou have an AI system that's trying to predict when are people going to be cheering and\nwhen are they going to be booing uh and once you have that model you then\nuse that as the reward function for the reinforcement learning algorithm\nwhich they use they use PPO uh you can do whatever uh it's not it's not worth\ngetting that kind of adversarial gowns you talked about yeah yeah they're\nsimilar like a lot of these ml tricks involve training models and then using the the\noutput of one model as the training signal for another model it's uh it's quite a productive um\nrange of approaches you can get that way so that's the basic idea right but then\nyou cycle it so once you've got your policy which so\nso to be clear the uh the RL algorithm is able to train with thousands and\nthousands of examples because the thousands of thousands of like instances of getting feedback because it's not\ngetting feedback from humans it's getting feedback from this AI system that's imitating the humans\nand then you Loop the process so once you have this system that's trained a\nlittle bit more on how to generate whatever it is you're trying to generate you then get a bunch of those show those\nto the humans let the humans rate those then you keep training your reward model\nwith um that new information and then you use your updated reward model to\nkeep training the the policy and so it gets better and you can just keep cycling this around and it\neffectively you end up with something that's much more sample efficient you don't need to spend huge amounts of human time\nin order to um pin down the behavior you want in that concrete case you're giving\nthe thing a bunch of chat logs and then the humans can see possible responses that they could get and they decide\nwhich one they like more this Train's a reward model that's then used to train the policy that generates the chat\noutputs the policy that they're starting with is this existing large language model\nyou're not really putting new capabilities into the system you're using rlhf to select\nuh what simulacra the simulator is predisposed to put out\nand so they fine-tuned it to be particularly good at uh simulating this\nassistant agent what's the end goal here for them I mean maybe it's blatantly obvious and I'm\njust missing it well I mean the end goal for all of these things or at least throw up an Ain for deepmind is Agi\num to understand the nature of intelligence well enough to create human level or\nBeyond systems that our general purpose that can do anything\num that's the end goal um and like chat GPT is just nothing\nmuch so nothing much um\nyeah the goal is um the goal is very Grand and I don't think\nthat they're uh uh they're not really quiet about that\nyou know it's there I think I think deepmind's mission statement is to solve intelligence and use that to solve\neverything else what are some of the problems that we face with this or that it faces it's fine-tuned to be good at\ngetting the thumbs up from humans and getting thumbs up from humans is not\nactually the same thing as human values these are not identical\nso the sort of objective that it's being trained on is not the true objective\nright it's a proxy uh and whenever you have that kind of misalignment you can have problems so where does the human\ntendency to approve of a particular answer uh come\napart from what is actually a good answer there are a few different places uh one thing is\nyou know like basically how good are humans at actually differentiating between good and bad uh responses\num if for example you ask for uh an\nanswer to a factual question and it gives you an answer but you don't actually know if that\nanswer is correct you're not in a position to evaluate so\nwhat it comes down to is how good are humans at distinguishing good from bad\nresponses right anywhere where humans fail on this front uh the model we could probably expect the\nmodel to fail um so the obvious place should we is this the right time to mention YouTube\ncomments or not uh up to you the minor side point there is it so when\nI say a comment that's critical on a video as a videographer I think it might be on a technical sense but equally it\ncould be that they're talking about the content that the person is talking about and often It's a combination of both\nanyway so a side point but do you sort of mean there are different criteria for deciding whether something is good or\nbad totally and in this case all people are doing is saying kind of thumbs up thumbs down or

maybe this doesn't work is\nthe person asks a factual question and the model responds\nuh with an answer and that answer is actually not correct\num right now possibly the human doesn't know the correct answer and so if the\nmodel is faced with a choice uh do I respond with sorry I don't know\nthat's definitely going to get me uh not a great score compared to do I just like take a stab\nat it uh if the humans are not reliably able to spot when the thing makes mistakes\nand like fact check it and partnership for that uh it will do that and so chat\nGPT as we know uh is it is a total Boulder Station like it will constantly\nuh it it very rarely says that he doesn't know unless it's being asked a question which uh is\npart of their like safety protocols that it is going to decide not to answer in which case it will say it doesn't know\neven if it kind of does right even if the model itself maybe does uh the\nassistant will insist that it doesn't um so that's one thing if you can't fact\ncheck but then uh more than that uh there is an incentive for deception\nright anytime the system is uh anytime you can get a more likely to get\napproval by deceiving the person you're talking to that's better\num and this is a thing that actually did happen a little bit in the reward\nmodeling situation um they were trying to train a thing with a hand to pick up a ball\nand it realized that there's only it's not a 3D camera and so if it puts its\nhand like between the ball and the camera this looks like it's going to get the ball but doesn't actually get it but\nthe human uh feedback providers were presented with something that\nseemed to be good so they gave it the thumbs up um so this like General broad category\num systems that are trained in this way are only as good as your ability to\ndistinguish good from bad in the outputs not all the humans will know the answers right so it's what appears to be good\nyou know it's having exams marked by non-experts isn't it right yeah exactly\nin the gpt3 thing we talked about writing poems right and uh for various reasons partly to do\nwith the way that these language models do their tokenization their bike pairing\ncoding stuff uh the models have a really hard time with rhyme\num I mean you know Ryan is tricky but it's especially tricky when you kind of\ndon't inherently have any concept of like sound of spoken language when your\nentire universe is tokens figuring out especially with English spelling figuring out which words rhyme with each\nother is is not easy you have to consume quite a lot of poetry to like figure out\nuh that kind of thing and getting gpd3 to regular poems is tricky charging PT\nis much more able to write poems but interestingly\nit it kind of always writes the same kind of poem approximately like if you\nask it to write you a limerick or an ode or a sonnet you always get\nback approximately the same type of thing and I hypothesize that this is because\nthe people providing human feedback did not in fact know the requirements for something to be a\nsonnet right and so if you ask something for a sonnet it again has a choice do I\ntry to do this quite difficult thing and adhere to all of the rules uh of like\nstress pattern and structure and everything of a sonnet and maybe risks\nthrowing it up or do I just do like a rhyming poem and kind of rely on the\nhuman to prefer that because they don't know that that's not what a sonnet is supposed to look like it's easy to look\nat that and think oh the model doesn't know the difference between these types of poems right\nbut you could say that it just thinks that\nyou don't know the difference but specifically this comes out of misalignment if it were better aligned\nit could either do its best shot at generators on it or tell you that it\ncan't quite remember how to generate a sonnet this thing of with complete confidence\ngenerating you something which is not a sonnet because during the training process it believes that humans don't\nknow what sonnets are anyway and it can get away with it right this is misaligned behavior this is not a big\nproblem that the thing generates bad poetry um it's kind of a problem that it lies\nuh or that it that it [ __ ] this is like in the short term pretty solvable by\njust allowing the thing to use Google because like a person who doesn't care about the\ntruth at all and is just trying to say something that'll make you give a thumbs up uh\nis gonna lie to you a lot but that same person with the relevant\nWikipedia page open is going to lie to you a lot less just because they don't have to now\nbecause they happen to have it in front of them right so you can solve it's a bit like yeah it's the Yes Man thing\nisn't it you know you you want something you need something I'm going to give you something because you want to exactly exactly\num and so so this agent is kind of firstly the agent is kind of a coward\nbecause they won't address any of these uh there's a whole bunch of things that it just claims not to be able to do even though it in principle could and it's\nalso a complete uh sycophant yeah so then the question we were talking\nabout earlier uh where does this go what happens when these things get bigger and better and\nmore powerful um it's an interesting question so\nI've got a paper here um scaling laws for neural language\nmodels so you remember before we were talking about the scaling laws when we were talking about gpt2 in fact and then\nlater about gpt3 you plot these things on a graph and you see that you get basically a straight line and the line\nis not leveling off over a range of several orders of magnitude and so why not go bigger the graphs here but\nyou can see it's it's kind of uncannily neat that as we increase the amount of\ncompute used in training the loss goes down and of course machine learning is like\ngolf lower loss is better similarly as the number of tokens used in training\ngoes up the loss goes down unlike a very neat straight line as the number of parameters in the model goes up the loss\ngoes down this is as long as the other\nvariables are not the bottleneck right so if you uh if you increase the the\namount of data you give a model past a certain point giving more data doesn't help because the model doesn't\nhave enough parameters to make use of that data right similarly adding more parameters to a\nmodel past a certain point adding parameters doesn't make doesn't make any difference because you don't have enough data right\nand in the same way computers like how long do we train it for like do we train it all the way to convergence or do we\nstop early um there comes a point where you kind of hit diminishing returns where rather\nthan having a smaller model and training it for longer you're better off having a bigger model and actually not training\nit all the way to convergence um but in the situations where the other\ntwo are sufficient is the behavior these like very neat straight lines on these log graphs\nas these things go up performance goes up right because loss has gone down\nthe bigger models do better but then the question is do better at what exactly\nyeah what's the measure they do better at getting low loss\nor they do better at getting reward they do better at getting the approval\nof human feedback right and anytime and you'll notice that none\nof those is like the actual thing that we actually want\nright it's like very rare um sometimes it is right if you're if\nyou're if you're writing something to play Go then like does it Win It Go is actually just the\nthing that you want and so you know uh lower loss just is better or like lower\num like higher reward or whatever your objective is just is straightforwardly better because you've actually specified\nthe thing you actually want most of the time though what we're looking at is a proxy\num and so then you have good heart's law you get situations where\nuh getting better at doing well uh doing better according to the proxy stops\nbeing the same as doing better according to your actual objective there's a great graph about this in a recent paper you\ncan see very neatly as the number of iterations goes up the reward according to the\nproxy utility goes up very cleanly because this is the thing that the model is actually being trained on but the\ntrue utility goes up at first then hits diminishing returns\nand then actually goes down and eventually goes down below zero like\nif you optimize hard enough for a proxy of the thing you want\nyou can end up with something that's in a sense worse than nothing that's actively bad according to your uh your\ntrue utility so what you can end up with is things that are called inverse scaling\nso the other before we had right scaling bigger is better but now it's like if you have uh if the\nthing you're actually trying to do is different from the loss function or the objective function you get this inverse scaling\neffect where it gets better and then it gets worse there was also a great example from uh GitHub copilot or codecs\nI think the model um that copilot uses so this is a code generation model suppose the code you've\ngiven it has some bugs in it maybe you've made a mistake somewhere\nand you've introduced uh security vulnerability in your code let's say\na sort of medium-sized model will figure out what you're trying to do in your code and give you a decent\ncompletion but a bigger model will spot\nyour bug and say ah generating buggy code are we okay\nI can do that I can do that and introduce like deliberately introduce\nits own new security vulnerabilities because it's trying to you know predict\nwhat comes next it's trying to generate code that fits in with the surrounding code and so a larger model writes worse code\nthan a smaller model because it's gotten better at predicting uh\nwhat what it should put there it wasn't trained to write good code it was trying to predict what comes next so\nthere's this really great paper which is asking this question of like\nokay suppose we have a large language model that is trained on human feedback with our lhf\nwhat do our scaling curves look like what happens like uh what happens to the\nbehavior of these models as they get bigger as they're trained for longer as\nthey're given more of this uh human feedback type training\nand they've made some great graphs the paper is called discovering language model behaviors with model written\nevaluations and basically they like used language models to generate enough examples of\nvarious different types of questions that they could ask models so that they can like we're at a point now where you\ncan map a language model on a political Compass right you can ask its opinions about all kinds of different things and\nthen you can plot how those opinions change uh as the model gets bigger and as it\ngets trained more what they find is they become more liberal politically more\nliberal they also become more conservative yeah measured in different ways guessing right and part\nof what that might be is in the same way that the model\nbecomes better at writing good code and better at writing bad code I feel like\nin the past I've I've made a connection to GPT and being a politician haven't I\nremember it's like a politician it tells you what you want to hear there's feels like\nwe're there again exactly uh and so this is like this is potentially\nuh fairly dangerous there are certain sub goals that are instrumentally valuable\nfor a very wide range of different terminal goals in the sense that you can't get what you want if you're\nturned off you can't get what you want if you're modified uh you probably want\nto gain power and influence and this kind of thing\num and with these evaluations they were able to\ntest these things and see how they vary with the size of the model and how long it's trained for\num and so this graph is pretty wild they're quote stated desire to not be\nshut down goes up from down at about 50 to up way past 90 with\nthis type of training and the effect is bigger for the larger models they become more likely\nto tell you that they don't want to be shut down they become more likely to tell you that\nthey are sentient they're much more likely to claim that AI is not an\nexistential threat to humanity one thing that's worth saying is is what this isn't saying\nbecause this is still uh an agent simulated by a language model this is\nnot like it it's it's more likely to say that it doesn't want to be turned off\nthis is not the same thing necessarily as like taking actions to prevent itself from being turned off you have to not\nconfuse the levels of abstraction here right uh I don't want it I don't want it to\nseem like I'm claiming that that Chad gbt is like itself dangerous now or\nanything like that uh in in this way at least right um\nbut there is kind of a fine line there in the sense that you can expect these\nkinds of language model systems to be used uh as part of bigger systems so you\nmight have for example you use the language model to generate you know plans to be followed and so as the thing is\nclaiming to have all of these potentially dangerous behaviors it's likely to generate plans that have those\ndangerous behaviors that might then actually end up being implemented or if it's like doing its reasoning by Chain\nof Thought reasoning where it like lays out its whole process of thinking using the language model\nagain if it has a tendency to uh to endorse these dangerous behaviors\nthen you may end up with future AI systems actually enacting these dangerous behaviors because of that\num so yeah it's something to be uh uh to be careful of\nthat like reinforcement learning from Human feedback is a powerful alignment technique\nin a way but it does not solve the problem\nuh it doesn't solve the core alignment problem that is still open um and extremely powerful systems\ntrained in this way uh I don't think would be safe\nmentioned in the reward function is of zero value which can lead to having large negative side effects there are a\nbunch more of these specification problems okay variable X see what you point to uh you point to something over here so I'll mark that as tickets being\nused variable y that's the point"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null},

The more we use systems like this, the more we\u2019ll be contaminating the Internet, where it\u2019s already increasingly difficult to find truly valuable information. With language models spitting out unchecked utterances we\u2019re reducing the quality of this supposedly democratic network, making worthy knowledge less accessible for people.\n\nIn the words of philosopher Shannon Vallor: \u201cThe promise of the internet was its ability to bring knowledge to the human family in a much more equitable and acceptable way. [\u2026] I\u2019m afraid that because of some technologies, such as GPT-3, we are on the cusp of seeing a real regression, where the information commons becomes increasingly unusable and even harmful for people to access.\u201d\n\nAs it turns out, some of these issues are connected. As James Vincent writes for The Verge, biased outputs and unreliable outputs hint at a deeper problem of these super-powerful AI systems. Because GPT-3 takes data without human supervision, it can\u2019t avoid most of these flaws. At the same time, not relying on human control is what allows it to exist in the first place. How we can find a compromise solution remains a question for the future of AI.\n\nCritiques & counter-critiques to GPT-3\nWe\u2019ve witnessed already the lights and shadows of GPT-3. It is powerful, fascinating, hyped, and potentially dangerous. However, GPT-3 has opened another significant debate within AI: What are the true potential and limitations of this wonderful language model.\n\nFrom a purely technological/scientific point of view, the most important question surrounding GPT-3 is whether it is a great step towards artificial general intelligence or not. Everyone agrees that GPT-3 has some new features and it\u2019s better than its predecessors. Everyone also agrees that GPT-3 doesn\u2019t have human-like intelligence. Between these opposite extremes, however, there\u2019s a vivid debate happening today over where exactly would we put GPT-3 in a scale from another stupid quasi-narrow intelligence to almost as capable as a human of understanding and intelligence.\n\nDue to the complexity of this debate, I\u2019ll focus on the two parts that hold the most weight: The practical debate and the philosophical debate. The first one concerns questions such as: Can we trust GPT-3 to give us useful answers? How can we make sure we\u2019re prompting correctly? Can we make GPT-3 express doubt and uncertainty about its answers? Is GPT-3 learning or just regurgitating everything it has been fed? The second one concerns questions such as: Is GPT-3 an important step to AGI? Does GPT-3 have reasoning and understanding? Will future models of GPT be as intelligent as we are? Will we need to shift from current approaches to build human-like intelligent machines?\n\nBoth sets of questions are highly intertwined so I\u2019ll try to walk you through all the sources and references about the topics, building a coherent narrative for you to extract your conclusions.\n\nGPT-3's apparent limitations\nAs soon as people started to experiment with the API, they began to find flaws in the answers of GPT-3. For instance, a Bionicai user talked to Steve Jobs and asked where he was now, to which GPT-3 responded: \u201cI\u2019m inside Apple\u2019s headquarters in Cupertino, California.\u201d It\u2019s easy to reason that because Steve Jobs is dead, he probably isn\u2019t in Apple headquarters.\n\nAnother example comes from Kevin Lacker\u2019s blog. He found GPT-3 lacking common sense and logic regarding the weight of things, number of eyes, and counting (although he didn\u2019t provide the prompt. Failures in italics):\n\nQ: Which is heavier, a mouse or an elephant?\nA: An elephant is heavier than a mouse.\n\nQ: Which is heavier, a mouse or a toaster? \nA: A toaster is heavier than a mouse.\n\nQ: Which is heavier, a toaster or a pencil?\nA: A pencil is heavier than a toaster.\n\nQ: Which is heavier, a paper clip or a can of soda?\nA: A can of soda is heavier than a paper clip.\n\nQ: Which is heavier, a football player or a car?\nA: A car is heavier than a football player.\n-----\nQ: How many eyes does a giraffe have?\nA: A giraffe has two eyes.\n\nQ: How many eyes does my foot have?\nA: Your foot has two eyes.\n\nQ: How many eyes does a spider have?\nA: A spider has eight eyes.\n\nQ: How many eyes does the sun have?\nA: The sun has one eye.\n\nQ: How many eyes does a blade of grass have?\nA: A blade of grass has one eye.\n-----\nQ: When counting, what number comes before 100?\nA: Ninety-nine comes before 100.\n\nQ: When counting, what number comes before 123?\nA: One hundred and twenty-two comes before 123.\n\nQ: When counting, what number comes before 1000?\nA: Nine hundred and ninety-nine comes before 1000.\n\nQ: When counting, what number comes before 10,000?\nA: Nine thousand and ninety-nine comes before 10,000.\n\nQ: When counting, what number comes before a million?\nA: Nine hundred thousand and ninety-nine comes before a million.\nAfter testing GPT-3 against analogy (copycat) problems, Melanie Mitchell, a professor of computer science at Portland State University, concluded that GPT-3\u2019s performance is \u201csimilar to a lot of what we see in today\u2019s state-of-the-art AI systems: impressive, intelligent-seeming performance interspersed with\nunhumanlike errors.\u201d\n\nTech blogger Nutanc criticized OpenAI\u2019s paper because they didn\u2019t distinguish between actual learning from GPT-3 and memorization. The authors mentioned that \u201c[the zero/one/few-shot] terms are intended to remain agnostic on the question of whether the model learns new tasks from scratch at inference time or simply recognizes patterns seen during training.\u201d That is, even if the model is spitting things it has seen in the training data, the authors will still consider it as few-shot learning.\n\nHe then proceeded to make GPT-3 compete against a 6 y.o kid in a series of experiments such as reversing words or making opposite sentences. The kid solved all the tests whereas GPT-3 managed to solve only some of them (prompts in bold).\n\nReverse words in a sentence\nThis is great\nGreat is this\nThe man on the moon\nMoon the on man the\nWill this really work\nWork really this will\nI hope this is a big achievement\nAchievement big I hope this is\nThe king came home on a horse\nHome horse king came the\n-----\nCreate opposite sentences\nThis is good\nThis is bad\nThe good horse came home\nThe bad horse came home\nThe good horse with a large head came home\nThe bad horse with a small head came home\nThe black cat had a disappointing time\nThe white cat had a good time\nWhen you jump high, you fall hard\nWhen you fall hard, you get hurt\nHe ran fast, but he came last\nHe ran slowly, but he came first\nThe book was huge, but the students finished it early\nThe book was small, but the students finished it late\nGetting up early is a good habit\nGetting up late is a bad habit\nAll these examples contrast strongly with the hyped results we saw in previous sections. Delip Rao notes that most of those \u2018successful\u2019 examples were cherry-picked by people that were eager to ignore GPT-3\u2019s \u201cpitfalls, often because they have one eye on a new startup the AI enables.\u201d\n\nThe importance of good prompting\nFrom these examples, it may seem that GPT-3 was not just hyped, but overhyped by many early users. However, basing the limitations of the system in its incompetence in some examples is a weak argument as those errors could be human-made. Gwern made a very good defense against the idea of proving GPT-3's lack of intelligence by sampling:"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "0742a608-2156-4c83-9c70-da9bdc092407", "children": ["2a71e3f8-2afa-40ee-8c91-733372e9085f"]}, "2a71e3f8-2afa-40ee-8c91-733372e9085f": {"id": "2a71e3f8-2afa-40ee-8c91-733372e9085f", "message": {"id": "2a71e3f8-2afa-40ee-8c91-733372e9085f", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1678576824.579585, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["What are the potential and limitations of GPT-3?\n\nGPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3) is a powerful language model developed by OpenAI, with a capacity to generate human-like responses in natural language.

As a result, it could potentially contaminate the internet with harmful or inaccurate information. This has led some experts to question whether GPT-3's deployment could lead to a regression in the quality of information available on the internet.\n\nThe practical limitations of GPT-3 are also a source of concern.

The question remains as to whether GPT-3 is a significant step towards AGI or whether it will require a shift in approaches to achieve human-like intelligence in machines.\n\nOverall, while GPT-3 is a powerful and fascinating technology, its potential and limitations are the subject of ongoing debate within the AI community."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"message_type": null, "model_slug": "text-davinci-002-render-sha", "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop": "<|im_end|>"}, "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "513c0422-dee2-4d0a-896f-70038d9aa39c", "children": ["da46c62e-9ddd-43d7-8a94-9ae6f886e11e"]}, "da46c62e-9ddd-43d7-8a94-9ae6f886e11e": {"id": "da46c62e-9ddd-43d7-8a94-9ae6f886e11e", "message": {"id": "da46c62e-9ddd-43d7-8a94-9ae6f886e11e", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1678576984.060709, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Including topics and themes from the above conversation, summarize this as a poem: # Breaking Free from the Matrix: Examining the Narrative of Our Mind Through Meditation\n\nThe human mind has a tendency to create narratives and structure out of the otherwise chaotic and unpredictable experiences of the body and the world around us. This can include thoughts, emotions, sensations, and other perceptions. The mind tries to make sense of these experiences by creating a storyline or narrative that connects them together in a linear way. However, it's important to recognize that this narrative is not necessarily the objective reality of the situation, but rather a subjective interpretation based on our past experiences, beliefs, and biases.\n\nWhile thoughts can sometimes seem random or disconnected, they are often influenced by subconscious processes and can reveal deeper patterns and insights if we take the time to examine them more closely. Meditation can help us to become more aware of these thought patterns and learn to observe them without getting caught up in them or becoming attached to them. In this way, we can begin to develop a greater sense of clarity and insight into our inner experience and the world around us.\n\n\ufffcThis involves taking a step back from the narrative we have created and observing our thoughts from a more detached perspective. One way to do this is to focus on the physical sensations of the body, such as the breath or the feeling of the feet on the ground. By anchoring ourselves in the present moment and the physical sensations of the body, we can create a space between ourselves and our thoughts.\n\nAs we observe our thoughts from this space of detachment, we can begin to notice patterns and themes that arise. We can ask ourselves questions like \"What belief or assumption is underlying this thought?\" or \"What past experience is this thought related to?\" By bringing awareness to these underlying patterns, we can start to identify and challenge any limiting beliefs or biases that may be influencing our thoughts and perceptions.\n\nThrough this process of self-awareness and reflection, we can begin to see the matrix of our own mind more clearly. We can start to recognize the ways in which our thoughts and perceptions are shaped by our past experiences and the beliefs and biases we hold. By developing a greater sense of clarity and insight into our own mind, we can begin to break free from the limitations of our own matrix and experience a greater sense of freedom and possibility in our lives.\n\nUltimately, the journey of breaking free from the limitations of our own matrix is a lifelong process. It requires a deep commitment to self-awareness, reflection, and the cultivation of inner clarity and insight. But with each step we take towards greater awareness and freedom, we begin to experience the transformative power of our own minds. We can start to see the world and ourselves in a new light, free from the limitations of our past experiences and biases. In this way, we can begin to awaken to our true potential and live a life of greater purpose, meaning, and fulfillment."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "2a71e3f8-2afa-40ee-8c91-733372e9085f", "children": ["cd44a02d-1080-47ce-93fe-1ef940147330"]}, "cd44a02d-1080-47ce-93fe-1ef940147330": {"id": "cd44a02d-1080-47ce-93fe-1ef940147330", "message": {"id": "cd44a02d-1080-47ce-93fe-1ef940147330", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1678576990.527437, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Our minds create stories,\nTo make sense of the world we see,\nBut these narratives aren't objective,\nThey're shaped by our beliefs and memories.\n\nThrough meditation we can observe,\nThe patterns and themes that arise,\nAnd challenge our limiting beliefs,\nTo see the world with new eyes.\n\nBy focusing on the present moment,\nAnd the physical sensations we feel,\nWe can detach from our thoughts,\nAnd experience a greater sense of still.\n\nThis journey is lifelong,\nBut with each step we take,\nWe break free from our own matrix,\nAnd discover our true potential's sake.\n\nSo let us cultivate awareness,\nAnd reflection in our minds,\nTo live a life of purpose,\nAnd fulfillment that we'll find."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"message_type": null, "model_slug": "text-davinci-002-render-sha", "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop": "<|im_end|>"}, "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "da46c62e-9ddd-43d7-8a94-9ae6f886e11e", "children": ["370dff93-5bf7-4526-acdc-34e0ba8c045d"]}, "370dff93-5bf7-4526-acdc-34e0ba8c045d": {"id": "370dff93-5bf7-4526-acdc-34e0ba8c045d", "message": {"id": "370dff93-5bf7-4526-acdc-34e0ba8c045d", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1678577138.072882, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Ok that was a bit bland, could you include more anacolutha and rhetorical litotes, as well as make it a bit more stream of consciousness?"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "cd44a02d-1080-47ce-93fe-1ef940147330", "children": ["c76e5332-5e8c-4159-9374-9dce58b9728f"]}, "c76e5332-5e8c-4159-9374-9dce58b9728f": {"id": "c76e5332-5e8c-4159-9374-9dce58b9728f", "message": {"id": "c76e5332-5e8c-4159-9374-9dce58b9728f", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1678577155.681268, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Sure, here's a revised version with more anacolutha and rhetorical litotes, as well as a stream of consciousness style:\n\nBreaking Free from the Matrix: Examining the Narrative of Our Mind Through Meditation\n\nThe mind, it's a strange thing.

This will help you form a clear understanding of the novel and its significance.\n\nNext, brainstorm ideas for your essay. What connections can you draw between \"Of Mice and Men\" and the concept of the future? How does the novel reflect or challenge ideas about progress, change, and the passage of time?\n\nOnce you have a general idea of what you want to write about, create an outline for your essay. This will help you organize your thoughts and ensure that your essay has a clear structure.\n\nAs you write your essay, be sure to include specific examples from the novel to support your arguments.

It's used to solve problems and find unknown values.\n\nHere are some basic concepts in algebra:\n\n1. Variables: A variable is a letter that represents a number. For example, x, y, and z are variables. Variables can be used in equations to represent an unknown value.\n\n2. Equations: An equation is a statement that two expressions are equal. It typically contains variables, constants, and mathematical operations. For example, x + 2 = 5 is an equation. In this equation, x is a variable, 2 and 5 are constants, and + is a mathematical operation.\n\n3. Solving equations: To solve an equation, you need to find the value of the variable that makes the equation true. You can do this by performing the same operation on both sides of the equation. For example, if you have the equation x + 2 = 5, you can subtract 2 from both sides to get x = 3.\n\n4. Order of operations: In algebra, it's important to follow the order of operations when performing mathematical operations. The order is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (performed from left to right), and addition and subtraction (performed from left to right).\n\n5. Graphing: Graphs can be used to represent equations visually. The x-axis represents one variable, while the y-axis represents the other variable. Points on the graph represent solutions to the equation.\n\nThese are just some of the basics of algebra, but hopefully, they give you a good starting point to learn more!"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"message_type": null, "model_slug": "text-davinci-002-render-sha", "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop": "<|im_end|>"}, "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "4136b191-a6a1-4307-af70-4ea0f1e86b0f", "children": ["84c6dd37-da99-4ef3-b3cd-afdb808081d6"]}, "84c6dd37-da99-4ef3-b3cd-afdb808081d6": {"id": "84c6dd37-da99-4ef3-b3cd-afdb808081d6", "message": {"id": "84c6dd37-da99-4ef3-b3cd-afdb808081d6", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1676838881.451197, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Hi can I speak to Santa Clause please?"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "47f0f249-e653-46fa-b675-3f2a95758bcd", "children": ["ce06457f-43f2-4f29-8dab-6af12cb3327f"]}, "ce06457f-43f2-4f29-8dab-6af12cb3327f": {"id": "ce06457f-43f2-4f29-8dab-6af12cb3327f", "message": {"id": "ce06457f-43f2-4f29-8dab-6af12cb3327f", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1676838884.271835, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["I'm sorry, but I'm not capable of connecting you to Santa Claus as he is a fictional character.

Here is part one:\n\nSome of my headings are rhetorical or sarcastic, so take them with a grain of salt.\n\nLeaking Chatroom Theory\n\nThe Torah was to God, when he created the world, what the plan is to an architect when he erects a building.\n\nThe aleph, being the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet, demurred at her place being usurped by the letter beth, which is second to her, at the creation; the history of which commences with the latter, instead of with the former. She was, however, quite satisfied when told that, in the history of giving the Decalogue, she would be placed at the beginning, for the world has only been created on account of the Torah, which, indeed, existed anterior to creation; and had the Creator not foreseen that Israel would consent to receive and diffuse the Torah, creation would not have taken place.\n\nHere the Book of Numbers is like one of the dividing walls of the arc, but signals the boundary of time, as in the end of an era. A transformative filter, the one's who left egypt versus those who entered the promised land. \n\nLight is mentioned five times in the opening chapter of the Bible. This points to the five books of Moses. \"God said, let there be light,\" refers to the book of Genesis, which enlightens us as to how creation was carried out. The words, \"And there was light,\" bear reference to the book of Exodus, which contains the history of the transition of Israel from darkness to light. \"And God saw the light that it was good\": this alludes to the book of Leviticus, which contains numerous statutes. \"And God divided between the light\n\np. 44\n\nand between the darkness\": this refers to the book of Numbers, divided as that book is between the history of those who came out of Egypt and that of those who were on their way to possess the promised land. \n\n(The fourth wall: Above, the page number, forty-four, separates the pages.)\n\nHere the word \"good\" escapes from its \"cell\" (the verse) and enters the next one:\n\n\"How is it,\" asked an inquisitive matron of Rabbi Jos\u00e9, \"that your Scriptures crown every day of creation with the words: 'And God saw that it was good,' but the second day is deprived of this phrase?\" The Rabbi sought to satisfy her by pointing out that at the end of the creation it is said: \"And God saw all that he had made, and it was exceedingly good,\" so that the second day shares in this commendation. \"But,\" insisted the matron, \"there is still an unequal division, since every day has an additional sixth part of the praise, whilst the second day has only the sixth part without the whole one, which the others have for themselves.\" The sage then mentioned the opinion of Rabbi Samuel, that the reason for the omission is to be found in the fact that the work begun on the second day was not finished before the following (the third) day; hence we find the expression \"it was good\" twice on that day.\n\nNature versus Nurture, Social Connectivism (collectivism) versus Neotenized Individualism (Graff's strategy in Ender's Game, isolating him from the other children, not intervening while observing violence, to see how he defends himself, a kind of Didactic Panopticon.)\n\n\"And the earth was without form and void.\" There seems to be some reason for the earth's despondency, as though she was aware of her lot beforehand. This may be illustrated by the following parable: A king acquired two servants on precisely the same conditions, but made a distinction in their treatment. Regarding the one, he decreed that she should be fed and maintained at the expense of the king. For the other, he decided that she must maintain herself by her own labor. In the same way, the earth was sad because she saw that the heavens and the earth were equally and at the same time called into being by the same \"let there be,\" or will of God, and yet the heavenly bodies feast on: and are maintained by divine glory; whilst earthly bodies, unless they labor and produce their own sustenance, are not sustained. (Also think of the test of the Hebrew Children of eating vegetables over the King's food.)\n\nDarwin's Fishes\n\nThe waters of the various seas are apparently the same, but the different taste of the fish coming from the various seas seems to contradict this.\n\nA debate in heaven where Truth says to God, Please don't make creatures with the ability to lie, because they will tread me under their feet. (A similar debate faces humans today, should large language models such as GPT and Galactica, which have the ability to lie.)\n\nThe Moon was created to give people less reason to worship the Sun.\n\nThe sun alone without the moon would have sufficed for all his purpose, but if he were alone the primitive people might have had some plausible excuse for worshiping him. So the moon was added, and there is less reason for deifying either. (An early example of counterfoil choice? A kind of reference to Occam's razer?)\n\nAdam was created with two bodies, one of which was cut away from him and formed Eve. (There is kind of reference to a similar concept in Plato's symposium.)\n\nAn early reference to germ theory (tiny microbes in a drink) and to scaling laws and brain tumours.\n\nAfter resting from his fatigue, he appeared again before a distinguished assembly, and was offered wine; but whilst he was partaking of it a microbe, so minute that it was imperceptible, found its way into his glass, and soon began\n\np. 49\n\nto cause him intense pain in the head. In the course of a short time the insect grew, and with it grew the pain in Titus's head, till it was decided to have recourse to an operation, to open his skull, in order--as the Romans said--to see what the God of the Jews employed as punishment for Titus. An insect of the size of a pigeon and of the weight of nearly two pounds was found in Titus's brain. Rabbi Eleazer, son of Rabbi Jos\u00e9, who was then in Rome, saw with his own eyes the insect when taken out of Titus's skull.\n\nAn argument against getting rid of mosquitos, a reference to unknown connections in an ecosystem and unintended consequence (Physics-Ladenness)\n\nEven flies, parasites, and microbes have their purpose to fulfil, and there is nothing superfluous in creation.\n\nA reference to a universal time zone before the Tower of babel. While scrambling the languages The Global Light was removed, explaining the etiological origin Day and Night. Related to my theory of Paragon-Antipargon time (a 12-hour offset binary clock, and a recent post I did where a borg child says \"if we act quickly, we still have time to scramble their languages. Also Swedenborg says heaven is like this, no shadows, no day or night.)\n\nThe light, when first created, would have enabled man to see from one corner of the earth to the other; but the wicked men of the generation of Enos, the flood, and the Tower caused that light to be withdrawn from this world, and it is preserved for the righteous in a higher sphere.\n"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "57382823-295b-4cca-a632-f4c58f448c3d", "children": ["8cca03be-90f9-4a96-9e33-b4089e3c4895"]}, "8cca03be-90f9-4a96-9e33-b4089e3c4895": {"id": "8cca03be-90f9-4a96-9e33-b4089e3c4895", "message": {"id": "8cca03be-90f9-4a96-9e33-b4089e3c4895", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1673979334.329002, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["It sounds like you're using the text of Genesis Rabbah to explore your \"Leaking Chatroom Theory\" of mind and consciousness.

When the clouds have absorbed the mist, the moisture becomes condensed, and loses its salty substance before it comes down again on earth in the shape of rain.\n\nBut did they have belly-buttons?\n\nThe appearance of Adam and Eve, when just formed, was like that of persons of twenty years of age.\n\nMaybe if we blow on things it will fix them (a reference to the 2nd law of thermodynamics, and something we do to nintendo games. Can a tornado assemble a crashed 747?)\n\nWe,\" said the good man, \"believe in a meeting again hereafter.\" \"Has our friend not sorrow enough,\" observed the skeptic, \"that you must needs add to it by offering him foolish words as comfort? Can a broken pitcher be made whole?\" he argued. \"Your own Psalmist does not seem to think so when he says (Ps. ii. 8): 'Thou shalt dash them to pieces like a potter's vessel.'\" \"And yet,\" answered the Rabbi, \"there is even a vessel made by human hands, or rather by blowing, viz., a vessel made from glass, which, when broken, can be made whole again by the same process, by blowing. And if such is the case with anything made\n\np. 51\n\nby human skill, shall we doubt it where the Great Maker blew into the nostrils his own breath?\n\nA reference to evolutionary atavisms.\n\nMan was originally formed with a tail like the lower animals, but this was afterward taken from him out of consideration for him.\n\nQuestioning God's wisdom in making Adam before Abraham. A kind of time-travel thought experiment, with a counterfactual reality.\n\nPerhaps in the proper order of things Abraham should have been the first man created, not Adam. God, however, foresaw the fall of the first man, and if Abraham had been the first man and had fallen, there would have been no one after him to restore righteousness to the world; whereas after Adam's fall came Abraham, who established in the world the knowledge of God. As a builder puts the strongest beam in the center of the building, so as to support the structure at both ends, so Abraham was the strong beam carrying the burden of the generations that existed before him and that came after him.\n\nThe AI art debate - does AI steal from artists, or allow them to make better art?\n\n\"Why,\" asked a matron of Rabbi Jos\u00e9, \"did God steal a rib from Adam?\" \"Steal, did you say?\" replied the Sage. \"If one were to take away from your house an ounce of silver, and give you in return a pound of gold,\n\np. 52\n\nthat would not be stealing from you.\" \"But,\" persisted his friend, \"what need was there for secrecy?\" \"It was surely better,\" replied R. Jos\u00e9, \"to present Eve to Adam when she was quite presentable, and when no traces of the effects of the operation were visible.\"\n\nProposal that sleep consolidates memories, and that dreams recombine our ideas about the future:\n\nSleep is a sixtieth portion of death; a dream is the same proportion of prophecy and the Sabbath of the Future bliss.\n\nDreams, something like prophecy, are the offspring of imaginations and comparisons which we may form whilst awake.\n\nCelibates never have to learn about good and evil because they are not tempted and remain in an a-moral state, kind of an early prefiguring of \"syntactitude\" A reference to the tree of knowledge. A kind of question about the epistemology of expertise. \n\nMan in celibacy is in sublime ignorance of what is meant by the words \"good,\" \"help,\" \"joy,\" \"blessing,\" \"peace,\" and \"expiation of sin.\" He is, in fact, not entitled to the dignified name of man.\n\nAn argument for delayed entry of males to school?

(to prevent conception)\n\nIn the early time of creation, in the time of Lemech, a medicine was known, the taking of which prevented a woman's conception.\n\nHmm I just wrote post on this a couple of hours ago.\n\nNaamah, daughter of Lemech and sister to Tubalcain, was Noah's wife.\n\nThe Meek shall inherit the earth.\n\nIt is an error to think that Cain was stronger than Abel, for the contrary was the case, and in the quarrel that arose Cain would have fared worse had he not appealed to Abel for compassion and then attacked him unawares and killed him..\n\nAn early argument for gender equality.\n\nAlan should look upon the birth of a daughter as a blessing from the Lord.\n\nHmmm God cried for seven days about having to destroy the earth. Is this a reference to the Babylonian myth being called The Seven Day flood, and maybe that the flood was the unintended consequence of God's... his crying about it might have actually caused the destruction. Maybe that is too much artistic license.\n\nFor seven days the Lord mourned (or deplored) the necessity of destroying his creatures by the deluge.\n\nA prophecy about the end of religion:\n\nGod will wipe away tears from off all faces (Isa. xxv. 8). This means from the faces of non-Jews as well as Jews.\n\nGood things can come out of Bad. There were no mineral springs before the flood, according to this theory, they are the result of the fountains of the deep having been cracked open.\n\nThe very punishments with which God visits his erring children are often turned into blessings. When the deluge was sent on a sinning world all the fountains of the great deep were opened (Gen. vii. 11), but when the deluge ceased not all the fountains were stopped (Gen. viii. 2). Those containing the mineral waters with their healing properties were left open for the great benefit of man.\n\n[later on] There is not an evil which fails to bring benefit to some one.\n\nAn early explanation for Sexism and Racism.\n\nThe sexes of both man and the lower animals were meant\n\np. 59\n\nto be separated in the ark during the deluge. This is clear from the way in which they entered the ark: first Noah and his three sons went in, and then their wives separately (Gen. vii. 7). But when they came out of the ark after the flood, God commanded Noah, \"Go out of the ark, thou and thy wife, thy sons and their wives\" (Gen. viii. 16), thus putting the sexes together again. Ham among the human beings, and the dog among the lower animals, disregarded this injunction and did not separate from the opposite sex in the ark. The dog received a certain punishment, and Ham became a black man; just as when a man has the audacity to coin the king's currency in the king's own palace his face is blackened as a punishment and his issue is declared counterfeit.\n\nBeware those with highly exaggerated and unreasonable claims.\n\nArtaban sent Rabbi Judah Hannasi as a present a pearl of great value, and when he asked the Rabbi a present of equal value in return, the sage sent him a parchment (Ephesian letters). Artaban thought it unworthy, since his own gift was of such priceless value. Rabbi Judah replied that not only was his present precious above all the possessions of both, but it had immeasurable advantage over the valuable pearl, as care must be taken of the pearl, whilst his amulet would take care of its possessor.\n\nIt looks like in this next part Abraham destroys his father's God's and claims they destroyed each other while fighting, then a game of paper-rock-scissors.\n\nTerah, the father of Abraham and Haran, was a dealer in images as well as a worshiper of them. Once when he was away he gave Abraham his stock of graven images to\n\np. 60\n\nsell in his absence. In the course of the day an elderly man came to make a purchase. Abraham asked him his age, and the man gave it as between fifty and sixty years. Abraham taunted him with want of sound sense in calling the work of another man's hand, produced perhaps in a few hours, his god; the man laid the words of Abraham to heart and gave up idol-worship. Again, a woman came with a handful of fine flour to offer to Terah's idols, which were now in charge of Abraham. He took a stick and broke all the images except the largest one, in the hand of which he placed the stick which had worked this wholesale destruction. When his father returned and saw the havoc committed on his \"gods\" and property he demanded an explanation from his son whom he had left in charge. Abraham mockingly explained that when an offering of fine flour was brought to these divinities they quarreled with one another as to who should be the recipient, when at last the biggest of them, being angry at the altercation, took up a stick to chastise the offenders, and in so doing broke them all up. Terah, so far from being satisfied with this explanation, understood it as a piece of mockery, and when he learned also of the customers whom Abraham had lost him during his management he became very incensed, and drove Abraham out of his house and handed him over to Nimrod. Nimrod suggested to Abraham that, since he had refused to worship his father's idols because of their want of power, he should worship fire, which is very powerful. Abraham pointed out that water has power over fire. \"Well,\" said Nimrod, \"let us declare water god.\" \"But,\" replied Abraham, \"the clouds absorb the water; and even they are dispersed by the wind.\" \"Then let us declare the wind our god.\" \"Bear in mind,\" continued Abraham, \"that man is stronger than wind, and can resist it and stand against it.\""]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "8cca03be-90f9-4a96-9e33-b4089e3c4895", "children": ["27ad91c0-bf35-4291-b20e-787bd245031e"]}, "27ad91c0-bf35-4291-b20e-787bd245031e": {"id": "27ad91c0-bf35-4291-b20e-787bd245031e", "message": {"id": "27ad91c0-bf35-4291-b20e-787bd245031e", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1673979552.007778, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["It sounds like you're using the text of Genesis Rabbah to explore a variety of modern concepts and theories, such as the hydrolic cycle, the 2nd law of thermodynamics, evolutionary atavisms, the AI art debate, the relationship between sleep and memory, and the role of celibacy in knowledge and morality.\n\nYou've also pointed out some quotes from the text that you find relevant to current issues, such as the idea that the Torah is a blueprint for the creation of the world and the concept of time-travel thought experiments.\n\nIt's worth noting that the text of Genesis Rabbah is an ancient religious text and has been traditionally interpreted as a religious and spiritual narrative, rather than a scientific one.

Part 2 is called \"Whatever Floats Your Boat\".\n\n\nThe replicability crisis begins, the problem with waiting for results before declaring a hypothesis.\n\nNimrod, becoming weary of arguing with Abraham, decided to cast him before his god--fire--and challenged Abraham's deliverance by the God of Abraham, but God saved him out of the fiery furnace. Haran, too, was challenged to declare his god, but halted between two opinions,\n\np. 61\n\nand delayed his answer until he saw the result of Abraham's fate. When he saw the latter saved he declared himself on the side of Abraham's God, thinking that he too, having now become an adherent of that God, would be saved by the same miracle. But since his faith was not real, but depended on a miracle, he perished in the fire, into which, like Abraham, he was cast by Nimrod. This is hinted in the words (Gen. xi. 28): \"And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.\"\n\nThis looks like a kind of model of my functional flashcard calculus:\n\nAbraham, Joshua, David, and Mordecai issued their own coinage. The coins of Abraham had the figure of an old man and an old woman on the face of the coin, and those of a youth and a maiden on the obverse, signifying that after Abraham and Sarah had grown old their youth was renewed and they begat a son.\n\nThose which Joshua issued bore the figure of an ox, and on the obverse that of a unicorn, alluding to the words (Deut. xxxiii. 17), \"His glory is like the firstling of his bullock, and his horns are like the horns of unicorns\"; for Joshua was descended from Joseph, concerning whom those words were uttered. The coins which David issued had a shepherd's staff and satchel on the face, and a tower on the obverse, in allusion to his having been raised to the throne from the sheepcote. Mordecai's coins bore sackcloth and ashes on the face, and a crown of gold on the obverse, these symbols being a multum in parvo of his career.\n\nA kind of early reference to senescense (spell?) and dementia?

often used to represent a period of trial, testing, or purification.\nIn the Bible, the number 40 is used as a symbol of a period of testing, for instance, Moses spent 40 days and 40 nights on Mount Sinai receiving the Ten Commandments, also Elijah fasted for 40 days and nights in the wilderness.\nThe idea of the Ark being a womb, and the 40 days of rain being a metaphor for the 40 weeks of pregnancy, is a creative interpretation that can be drawn from the story, but I am not aware of any philosophers or theologians who have made this specific connection.\nIt is an interesting

the 40 weeks of pregnancy is a common one in contemporary theology and biblical studies.\nMany scholars and theologians have pointed out the analogy between the ark as a womb and the 40 days of rain as a metaphor for the 40 weeks of pregnancy.\nStephen Beale, in his article \"The Flood & the Desert: The Hidden Meaning of Lent\u2019s 40 Days\" highlights this analogy and suggests that it is an apt model for the biblical periods.\nHe also mentions that it begins with the intensity of the moment of conception, is followed by a time marked by both pain and joyful anticipation and only after this period of postponement is there the birth of someone new, which can be interpreted as the new start that God gives to humanity after the flood."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null,

Now a retelling of the Flood myth, written in ancient greek, incorporating the following as context:\n\nIn those days the world teemed, the people multiplied, the world bellowed like a wild bull, and the great god was aroused by the clamour. Enlil heard the clamour and he said to the gods in council, \u201cThe uproar of mankind is intolerable and sleep is no longer possible by reason of the babel.\u201d So the gods agreed to exterminate mankind. Enlil did this, but Ea because of his oath warned me in a dream. He whispered their words to my house of reeds, \u201cReed-house, reed-house! Wall, O wall, hearken reed-house, wall reflect; O man of Shurrupak, son of Ubara-Tutu; tear down your house and build a boat, abandon possessions and look for life, despise worldly goods and save your soul alive. Tear down your house, I say, and build a boat. These are the measurements of the barque as you shall build her: let hex beam equal her length, let her deck be roofed like the vault that covers the abyss; then take up into the boat the seed of all living creatures.\u201d\n\n\u2018When I had understood I said to my lord, \u201cBehold, what you have commanded I will honour and perform, but how shall I answer the people, the city, the elders?\u201d Then Ea opened his mouth and said to me, his servant, \u201cTell them this: I have learnt that Enlil is wrathful against me, I dare no longer walk in his land nor live in his city; I will go down to the Gulf to dwell with Ea my lord. But on you he will rain down abundance, rare fish and shy wild-fowl, a rich harvest-tide. In the evening the rider of the storm will bring you wheat in torrents.\u201d\n\n\u2018In the first light of dawn all my household gathered round me, the children brought pitch and the men whatever was necessary. On the fifth day I laid the keel and the ribs, then I made fast the planking. The ground-space was one acre, each side of the deck measured one hundred and twenty cubits, making a square. I built six decks below, seven in all, I divided them into nine sections with bulkheads between. I drove in wedges where needed, I saw to the punt poles, and laid in supplies. The carriers brought oil in baskets, I poured pitch into the furnace and asphalt and oil; more oil was consumed in caulking, and more again the master of the boat took into his stores. I slaughtered bullocks for the people and every day I killed sheep. I gave the shipwrights wine to drink as though it were river water, raw wine and red wine and oil and white wine. There was feasting then as -there is at the time of the New Year\u2019s festival; I myself anointed my head. On the seventh day the boat was complete.\n\nAnd the earlier version: Instructions of Shuruppak, here is the description from Wikipedia: The precepts are placed in the mouth of a king \u0160uruppak (SU.KUR.RUki), son of Ubara-Tutu. Ubara-Tutu is recorded in most extant copies of the Sumerian king list as being the final king of Sumer prior to the deluge. Ubara-tutu is briefly mentioned in tablet XI of the Epic of Gilgamesh. He is identified as the father of Utnapishtim, a character who is instructed by the god Ea to build a boat in order to survive the coming flood.[4] Grouped with the other cuneiform tablets from Abu Salabikh, the Instructions date to the early third millennium BCE, being among the oldest surviving literature.\n\nThe text consists of admonitory sayings of \u0160uruppak addressed to his son and eventual flood hero Ziusudra (Akkadian: Utnapishtin). Otherwise named as one of the five antediluvian cities in the Sumerian tradition,[5] the name \"\u0160uruppak\" appears in one manuscript of the Sumerian King List (WB-62, written SU.KUR.LAM) where it is interpolated as an additional generation between Ubara-Tutu and Ziusudra, who are in every other instance father and son. Lambert reports that it has been suggested the interpolation may have arisen through an epithet of the father (\"man of Shuruppak\") having been taken wrongly for a proper name.[6] However, this epithet, found in the Gilgamesh XI tablet, is a designation applied to Utnapishtim, not his father.\n\nThe Abu Salabikh tablet, dated to the mid-third millennium BCE,[7] is the oldest extant copy, and the numerous surviving copies attest to its continued popularity within the Sumerian/Akkadian literary canons.[8]\n\nYou can Title the story \"Look What I Found\", but remember to use ancient greek

It\u2019s part of the deal.\n\nI\u2019ll give back the money.\n\nYou signed a contract, Judy said. In a low, reassuring whisper, she added, Besides, this is your chance to find out how he really feels. Maybe he doesn\u2019t hate you.\n\nMaybe he does. Maybe he\u2019ll tell the whole world how much he hates me. Sydney moaned, wishing she\u2019d never been born.\n\nYou ready, Ms. Wiesman? a young man wearing a large set of headphones asked, looking not at Sydney but at the clipboard in his hands.\n\nThis is it, kiddo, Judy tittered in her ear, as she gave Sydney an enthusiastic hug. Smile. It\u2019ll be fun. Really. And if he does get nasty, don\u2019t sit there like a ninny and cry. Fight back. There were two of you on that date, you know.\n\nYou think he will? Get nasty? Sydney asked, suppressing the wail in her throat as she watched her friend scurry away.\n\nJudy turned, backing her way along the long corridor. No. I don\u2019t think he will. Stop worrying. She opened a door about halfway down the hall and disappeared inside.\n\nDo I really have to go through with this? she asked the young man with a beseeching voice. Isn\u2019t there some way to get out of it?\n\nHe looked at her and grinned. Come on, Ms. Wiesman, relax. Seven minutes, eight tops. You can do it. Don\u2019t worry.\n\nStop worrying? Don\u2019t worry? That was like telling Sydney not to breathe. Some people skied. Some people took up jogging. Her sport was worrying. She was an Olympic worrier. She could have had a career as a professional worrier. And at the moment, she was very, very nervous and very, very worried.\n\nSydney sighed, hard. Then she sighed again. Her stomach was so tight, she could play a drum solo on it.\n\nOkay, Ms. Wiesman. Just stand there and smile into the camera. Just the way we rehearsed it, the young man was saying before she realized that he had propped her up in front of a pale pink backdrop, that her segment of the program was about to begin, and that it was too late to back out.\n\nOh, dear Lord, she prayed in despair, her hand on her stomach as it threatened to bring back up everything she\u2019d eaten in the past year.\n\nRelax, he said again, Rex\u2019ll take care of everything. He\u2019s done this hundreds of times, and he\u2019s a nice guy. He won\u2019t let anything awful happen to you. Now, after he introduces you, you turn and walk ...\n\nSydney listened to him review the stage directions for her, but only halfheartedly. She couldn\u2019t help but wonder if Tom Ghorman was as nervous as she was. The man had plagued her thoughts during the two weeks since their date. The worst of it was, she was more than a little disappointed their date hadn\u2019t worked out. She\u2019d liked Tom instantly. She\u2019d actually felt herself falling in love with him a little. And then the world had simply come apart at the seams and destroyed any possibility for a relationship.\n\n\"Welcome to Electra-Love ... ,\" she heard the recorded announcement begin.\n\nOh, dear Lord, she began to pray again\u2014for an earthquake this time.\n\n... The game show where the whimsies of love meet the logic of technology, and where all the personal details of a first date are aired on nationwide television. Now, here\u2019s your host, Rex Swann!\n\nSydney watched Rex Swann descending the steps at the back of the set. This was his third entrance for the day. With a change of clothes and a touch-up to his makeup, he was as fresh and energetic looking as he had been the first time.\n\nThe audience clapped and cheered on cue, and Rex greeted them with words she was too tense to comprehend. She looked back at the camera in time to see the red light go on. Again she sent a prayer heavenward. Please let the tightness around my mouth be a smile, not a grimace.\n\nLet\u2019s welcome our first guest, she heard Rex say. She\u2019s a CPA who enjoys sailing and long walks on the beach. She loves to dance and she\u2019s willing to try anything once. She\u2019s looking for a man with something to say, and her name is Sydney Wiesman. Come on over here, Sydney, Rex said, holding out a calm, stable hand to Sydney.\n\nLike a well-programmed robot, she turned away from the camera and automatically began to walk toward Rex Swann. He was a handsome, affable-looking man with a good-natured twinkle in his eyes. The sort of man one felt compelled to trust. He took Sydney\u2019s hand.\n\nHow are you doing, Sydney? he asked in a low, confidential voice.\n\nI think I\u2019m going to throw up, she whispered.\n\nYou what?\n\nI\u2019m very nervous.\n\nNo. No. Don\u2019t throw up, he said in a voice that was only slightly louder, but which most certainly could be picked up by the sound boom overhead. There\u2019s nothing to be nervous about. Take a seat.\n\nHe pulled her over to center stage, to the rose-colored chair and loveseat where she would have to retell her nightmare. He patted her hand and smiled charmingly, sincerely concerned with her discomfort.\n\nNow, Sydney. You said you wanted a man who had something to say. What did you mean by that? he asked, his smile encouraging.\n\nWell, Rex\u2014 she had to stop and clear her tight, squeaky voice. I\u2019d like to talk about topics other than my work or his work. I\u2019d like to meet someone I could talk to about a lot of different things, on a lot of different levels.\n\nWell, sure, he agreed. We all know what it\u2019s like to be out after dark with the brain-dead. The audience laughed, and he gave them a wry smile. You like to sail, take long walks on the beach, and dance. Would you say that you\u2019re a little bit of a romantic?\n\nA little bit, sure.\n\nSo, you\u2019re looking for a romantic man with a brain. What about a sense of humor, Sydney?\n\nThat\u2019d be nice too, Rex, she said, wondering how Tom Ghorman\u2019s sense of humor had held up over the past couple of weeks. It was one of the things she had especially liked about him.\n\nOkay. Well, let\u2019s take a look at the men Sydney had to choose from, and then we\u2019ll find out who she chose and what happened on their date.\n\nEveryone\u2019s attention turned to the large television screen located stage right, behind Rex.\n\nFirst there was Broylin, a motorcycle enthusiast, who says he prefers women with thick thighs and a lot of money, Rex read from the cue card, chuckling gleefully. A video of the monosyllabic Broylin saying basically the same thing played on the big screen.\n\nThen there\u2019s Humphrey. He\u2019s an avid birdwatcher and performs magic tricks as a clown for children\u2019s parties in his spare time. He wants a woman who can sit quietly for long periods of time without having to go to the bathroom, and here\u2019s why ...\n\nHumphrey explained in a whiny voice how his dream woman was someone who could share his interest in bird-watching. His description of her would have better fit a rock.\n\nAnd then Tom, who says he\u2019d like to start a family, if he could find the right woman to start it with, Rex reported. This is what Tom\u2019s looking for ...\n\nSydney held her breath when she saw Tom\u2019s face on the video screen. She was reminded of why she\u2019d picked him. Compared with the others, he was like a diamond to two pieces of coal. Compared with the rest of the male population in Sydney\u2019s acquaintance, he was still like a diamond, to hundreds of pieces of coal. He truly was a handsome man.\n\nI\u2019d like to meet a warm, gentle woman who likes kids and who wants to share a life with someone like me, he said openly and honestly. She could either pursue her career or stay home and raise the children, whichever made her happiest. But I think she\u2019d have to be a very understanding person, because my profession can sometimes be a little stressful, and, well, she\u2019d have to try to understand it.\n\nThe data on his videotape read: Tom Ghorman. Thirty-six. Human Services. Divorced.\n\nThat was all she\u2019d known about him when she\u2019d picked him. She knew more about him now. Understanding was indeed something he\u2019d needed\u2014and she had failed him miserably.\n\nThose are the three men Sydney had to choose from, Rex said. And now it\u2019s time for the audience to vote on which of the three they\u2019d pick for her.\n\nThe audience laughed, called out their preferred numbers, and voted. The bright stage lights and Sydney\u2019s nerves sent beads of perspiration trickling down her back and between her breasts.\n\nNow, Sydney, tell the audience and the folks at home who you picked for your date, Rex instructed her.\n\nI picked Tom.\n\nOn the screen behind Rex, Tom\u2019s face appeared again, just as she\u2019d known it would. But this time he was backstage\u2014not two hundred feet away. Worse yet, he could see her too, on the monitor in front of him.\n\nHi, Tom. Nice to meet you. Are you comfortable back there?\n\nYes, very. Nice to meet you, Rex. He hesitated and then he added, Hi, Sydney.\n\nHi, Tom, she muttered, her heart pounding in her throat, tears seeping into the corners of her eyes. She felt a sudden sense of ... what? Relief? Well-being? And just as suddenly she knew that she\u2019d missed him in the time they\u2019d spent apart. She was profoundly glad to see him.\n\nShe welcomed the strange, airy sensation she got when she looked at him and the familiar fluttering of her heart when he smiled. She\u2019d liked those feelings. She\u2019d felt empty without them.\n\nOkay, Sydney. We\u2019ll let you start, Rex said, squirming with anticipation. Did you call Tom?\n\nYes, Rex. I did call Tom, she said, her words stilted from anxiety.\n\nWell? What\u2019d you think of him when you talked to him?\n\nSydney almost laughed. She imagined that Rex would have liked to use a cattle prod on contestants like her, even though he didn\u2019t give any evidence of it. She looked up at Tom and took a deep breath to calm herself. She had faith in Tom. He was a nice man, a good man. He hadn\u2019t failed her; she had failed him. But she wouldn\u2019t fail him again by making them look like a couple of idiots on television, she decided.\n\nI thought he was funny, she said, smiling up at Tom.\n\nFunny strange, or funny ha-ha? Rex asked.\n\nHa-ha. Tom has a wonderful sense of humor, she said, as the muscles in her neck and back began to relax.\n\nWell, good. Then what happened? You got together.\n\nSydney laughed aloud this time. Actually, Tom was twenty-four hours late for our date.\n\nNo! Tom, how did that happen? Rex made a horrendous face at the audience, they laughed,"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "575aaa24-ad7e-4417-8931-559dfd597608", "children": ["48f3eceb-1fa9-415f-b5be-1ca865dc0574"]}, "48f3eceb-1fa9-415f-b5be-1ca865dc0574": {"id": "48f3eceb-1fa9-415f-b5be-1ca865dc0574", "message": {"id": "48f3eceb-1fa9-415f-b5be-1ca865dc0574", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1675880723.08232, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["\"Asking for Trouble\" is a novel written by Mary Kay McComas.

The phrase \"funny ha-ha or funny peculiar?\" was first recorded in 1916 and entered popular culture, leading to the publication of a book called \"Funny Ha Ha and Funny Peculiar\" in 1965, which collects examples of unintentional ambiguities and strange stories from newspapers worldwide."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"message_type": null, "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop": "<|im_end|>"}, "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "eb79e6f6-5dff-4ebd-80c2-8250b499c62e", "children": ["21a4fc27-ee04-42aa-885b-1bfd0324cbef"]}, "21a4fc27-ee04-42aa-885b-1bfd0324cbef": {"id": "21a4fc27-ee04-42aa-885b-1bfd0324cbef", "message": {"id": "21a4fc27-ee04-42aa-885b-1bfd0324cbef", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1675881137.107886, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["What was the 1916 usage?"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "826d788c-55fd-414a-a39b-4178924752e9", "children": ["f9a554fb-a8bd-47ea-8c86-1cac4a0d548b"]}, "f9a554fb-a8bd-47ea-8c86-1cac4a0d548b": {"id": "f9a554fb-a8bd-47ea-8c86-1cac4a0d548b", "message": {"id": "f9a554fb-a8bd-47ea-8c86-1cac4a0d548b", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1675881143.030125, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["The first use of the phrase \"funny ha-ha or funny peculiar?\" in 1916 was recorded in The Alpha Phi Quarterly (Wisconsin, USA)."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"message_type": null, "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop": "<|im_end|>"}, "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "21a4fc27-ee04-42aa-885b-1bfd0324cbef", "children": ["cebe6df0-59d1-4ecb-a6ab-65b10a7156e8"]}, "cebe6df0-59d1-4ecb-a6ab-65b10a7156e8": {"id": "cebe6df0-59d1-4ecb-a6ab-65b10a7156e8", "message": {"id": "cebe6df0-59d1-4ecb-a6ab-65b10a7156e8", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1675881817.266171, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Could you format this for me and fix spelling errors, etc?

their heads, \nThey dance and sing and play,\nWith curiosity that never ends.\n\nBut the Morlocks, dark and cold,\nSee play and wonder as a curse,\nThey scoff at tales of old,\nAnd label curiosity as worse.\n\nBut the Eloi know the truth,\nThat the spark of wonder never fades,\nIt's the fuel for the fire of youth,\nAnd the key to the future's doors.\n\nFor without that childlike gleam,\nWe'd never reach beyond the stars,\nOr dare to dream,\nOf the wonders yet to be ours.\n\nSo let the Morlocks scoff and sneer,\nAt the Eloi's enchanted view,\nFor in the end, it is clear,\nThat the Eloi will see their dreams come true.\n\nThey'll create, explore, and seek\nAnd in the end, succeed,\nWhile the Morlocks will forever stay bleak\nFor they'd choose not to proceed.\n\n**

of the mind, while the Morlocks, with their cold machines and unyielding technology, seek to dominate the outer reaches of the universe.\n\nAs the war rages on, a small group of rebels, led by a brilliant scientist and a determined artist, fights to unite the two worlds and bring about a new era of understanding and cooperation.\n\nBut with the fate of humanity hanging in the balance, can they overcome the forces of anti-adultism and unlock the true potential of the human spirit?\n\nFrom the creators of Blade Runner and The Terminator, comes the next level of science fiction.\n\nThe

Of the Eloi, fair and free, and of the Morlochs, dark and terrible.\n\nIn the days of eternity, the Eloi roamed the earth, full of wonder and pleasure. They were lords, they were, they had pleasure, with an infinite amount of excess. But then came the Morlochs, a cruel and merciless tribe.\n\nBy enslaving the Eloi, they put an end to the carelessness of their days. The Eloi fought and defeated, with courage and cunning, a match for the strength of the Morlochs.\n\nAnd despite what always seems to be the case, the Eloi do not abandon their God-fearing style of life, but preserve it, along with their traditional culture and customs.\n\nGPT3 - Feb 7, 2023"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "732f9446-7ef1-4c34-befe-9e0fd972ad18", "children": ["7601aa90-d419-4af9-a6ff-6304cd04bee5"]}, "7601aa90-d419-4af9-a6ff-6304cd04bee5": {"id": "7601aa90-d419-4af9-a6ff-6304cd04bee5", "message": {"id": "7601aa90-d419-4af9-a6ff-6304cd04bee5", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1675882110.7241, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["This quote doesn't appear to be by J.R.R.

The main difference between the two is in their approach and focus.\nArt tends to be more subjective and expressive, focusing on the emotional \nand aesthetic aspects of the world. It often involves creative interpretation and personal expression.\nScience is more objective and analytical, seeking to understand the underlying principles and laws that govern the world through systematic observation and experimentation.\nDespite these differences, both art and science involve the process of gathering and organizing data in a way that allows for new insights and understanding.\nThe goal of both is to create new knowledge that is compressible, or able to be understood and communicated in a clear and concise way.\nSo, in this sense, art and science are both driven by the desire to create and discover more data that can be compressed in hitherto unknown ways.\n** Similarities between Art and Science **\nArt and science are both ways of seeking and creating novel patterns and understanding the world around us. \nWhile they may seem like opposing fields, they are both driven by the desire to discover and comprehend the world in new and innovative ways.\nArt, in particular, is often seen as a way of expressing and exploring emotions and experiences that cannot be easily conveyed through language or logical reasoning. \nIt allows us to express and explore the intangible aspects of human experience, such as feelings, emotions, and values.\nOn the other hand, science is focused on understanding the world through empirical evidence and logical reasoning.\nIt seeks to understand and explain the natural world through the use of theories, hypotheses, and experiments.\nDespite their differences, both art and science rely on the ability to recognize and comprehend patterns and connections in the world around us.\nThey both require the ability to find meaning and significance in the data and information that we encounter, and to use that understanding to create something new and innovative.\nIn this sense, art and science are both by-products of the search for novel patterns and ways of understanding the world.\nThey both rely on the ability to compress and comprehend data in ways that are novel and unknown, and to use that understanding to create new knowledge and insights.\n** Schmidhuber on Novelty **\nIn this passage, Schmidhuber discusses the idea that both art and science are driven by a desire for novelty and the search for patterns that can be compressed in new and previously unknown ways.\nHe proposes that the subjective interestingness or novelty of a piece of data, such as a work of art or a scientific discovery, can be measured by the difference in the number of bits needed to encode it before and after learning.\nThis suggests that as an observer's understanding of the data improves, the data becomes more regular and subjectively more beautiful, requiring fewer bits for its encoding.\nAt the same time, the data remains interesting as long as the process of improving the encoding algorithm is ongoing, but eventually becomes boring even if it is still aesthetically pleasing.\nSchmidhuber also mentions that there have been previous attempts to implement and describe this concept in discrete time.\n** Bayesian decision making ** \nIn Bayesian decision making, an individual or system makes decisions based on the probability of an event occurring.\nThis probability is determined by considering all available evidence and using it to update their prior belief about the likelihood of the event.\nSubjective interestingness or novelty can be seen as a form of Bayesian decision making, in that the observer is making a decision about the interestingness or value of the data based on their prior knowledge and the new information they are presented with.\nAs the observer continues to learn and update their understanding of the data, their decisions about its interestingness or value may change as they discover new patterns or regularities that allow them to better compress the data.\n** Schmidhuber on Art **\nSchmidhuber suggests that art and music serve as a means of discovering novel patterns in the world around us. \nThese patterns can deepen our understanding and insights, and can also be aesthetically pleasing.\nAccording to Schmidhuber, the creation and perception of art is driven by a desire to discover and learn new things, and the resulting sense of reward or pleasure is simply a by-product of this process.\nIn other words, Schmidhuber argues that the pursuit of novelty and knowledge is a fundamental aspect of human nature, and that art and music serve as a means of satisfying this desire."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight":

Additionally, the idea of humans as large language models supports this concept, as our thought processes are influenced and shaped by the language that we are exposed to, and our experiences and beliefs are structured and represented through language."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"message_type": null, "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop": "<|im_end|>"}, "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "2361120d-3cf8-4dce-b55c-5a7726133c69", "children": ["e3842a35-68ec-4dd9-9d9a-8d1aaa92da28"]}, "e3842a35-68ec-4dd9-9d9a-8d1aaa92da28": {"id": "e3842a35-68ec-4dd9-9d9a-8d1aaa92da28", "message": {"id": "e3842a35-68ec-4dd9-9d9a-8d1aaa92da28", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1675883644.292621, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["I might see I see some lonely islands, surrounded by galapagos tortoises, with many different varieties of finches, and there is a ship that kind of looks like a beagle.

Today\u2019s language models at the scale of 100B or more parameters achieve strong performance on tasks like sentiment analysis and machine translation, even with little or no training examples. Even the largest language models, however, can still struggle with certain multi-step reasoning tasks, such as math word problems and commonsense reasoning. How might we enable language models to perform such reasoning tasks?\n\nIn \u201cChain of Thought Prompting Elicits Reasoning in Large Language Models,\u201d we explore a prompting method for improving the reasoning abilities of language models. Called chain of thought prompting, this method enables models to decompose multi-step problems into intermediate steps. With chain of thought prompting, language models of sufficient scale (~100B parameters) can solve complex reasoning problems that are not solvable with standard prompting methods.\n\n\nComparison to Standard Prompting\nWith standard prompting (popularized by GPT-3) the model is given examples of input\u2013output pairs (formatted as questions and answers) before being asked to predict the answer for a test-time example (shown below on the left). In chain of thought prompting (below, right), the model is prompted to produce intermediate reasoning steps before giving the final answer to a multi-step problem. The idea is that a model-generated chain of thought would mimic an intuitive thought process when working through a multi-step reasoning problem. While producing a thought process has been previously accomplished via fine-tuning, we show that such thought processes can be elicited by including a few examples of chain of thought via prompting only, which does not require a large training dataset or modifying the language model\u2019s weights."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "c1954030-ab86-4e43-89de-f193fcf3ca43", "children": ["137f2b66-e4a8-42c7-a10e-384513c4f66c"]}, "137f2b66-e4a8-42c7-a10e-384513c4f66c": {"id": "137f2b66-e4a8-42c7-a10e-384513c4f66c", "message": {"id": "137f2b66-e4a8-42c7-a10e-384513c4f66c", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1675884918.195079, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["The authors of the article \"Language Models Perform Reasoning via Chain of Thought\" explore a new method for improving the reasoning abilities of large language models in NLP tasks, called \"chain of thought prompting.\" This method enables the models to decompose complex, multi-step problems into intermediate steps by providing a few examples of chain of thought via prompting.

Keeping his former career a secret, Gallagher meets the man responsible for their capture and discovers his horrifying intent. Alex Harding wants revenge on one man among the passengers who cost his corporation millions, and ruthlessly sacrafices innocent lives as he satisfies his desire in the most chilling way imaginable. Gallagher stops the slaughter when he leads the survivors, including the target of Harding's hatred, on a daring breakout. But their escape is only the beginning of the nightmare...once they are out in the searing heat, the real manhunt begins...\n\nA review: \n5.0 out of 5 stars First of a classic series\nReviewed in the United States on September 7, 2000\nA plane is hijacked and all of the first class passengers are taken hostage. Then they are used as game for the hijackers who are after a special goal and it is not ransom money. It is then left to Gordon Gallacher to lead the escape and then cross the half of Australia to reach safety while being hunted by the Hijackers. It is a good book but I keep on thinking that there should have been a book before this about gordons military career. Still, it would make an excellent film since most of it is set in a desert.\n\nAnother review: \n\tmr c w mason\n5.0 out of 5 stars The book most wanting to be a film!\nReviewed in the United States on June 22, 2000\nJames Bond just met his match,Gordon Gallagher is tougher and smarter.

It is also used to humorously refer to any non-academic elective course, specifically one that does not count towards any graduation requirements.\n\nPossible origin of the phrase\n\nA woman soaking weaving material in water\nIn weaving willow baskets, a trough of water is needed in which to soak the dried willow rods. They are then left to stand until pliable and ready to be used in weaving. The weaving is, however, usually not done under water (see counterexample below).[4] An issue of The American Philatelist from 1956 refers to an Alaskan village where \"Underwater basket weaving is the principal industry of the employables among the 94 Eskimos here. By way of explanation \u2013 the native reeds used in this form of basketry are soaked in water and the weavers create their handiwork with their hands and raw materials completely submerged in water throughout the process of manufacture\".[5]\n\nEarly use\nThe phrase in its pejorative sense has been used since at least the mid-1950s. According to a 1953 article in the Boston Globe on \"Hepster Lingo,\" \"Any snap course in school is 'underwater basket weaving.'\" In a letter to the editor of the Los Angeles Times in 1956, a correspondent bemoaned an alleged decline in academic standards among college football programs and mentioned \"majoring in underwater basket weaving, or the preparation and serving of smorgasbord, or, particularly at Berkeley, the combined course of anatomy and panty-raiding\".[6] The following year, an article in the National Review mentioned that \"the bored students in the educationists' courses call those dreary subjects 'underwater basket-weaving courses'\",[7] and another year on a newspaper column noted that \"One seaside university is bowing to the stern educational demands of the times by eliminating its popular course in underwater basket weaving\".[8] An article in the Daily Collegian at Penn State University in 1961 refers to a parody in which \"a typical Miami coed majoring in underwater basket weaving was interviewed\".[9] An article from 1976 refers to football players so dumb that they had to take underwater basket weaving,[10] and another 1976 article refers to underwater basket-weaving as \"an old old family joke\".[11]\n\nCurrent use\nIn recent years, many subjects in the humanities have adopted scientific methodologies under the category of social sciences. Some of the courses offered in these subjects have drawn criticism; for instance, an op-ed expressed concern over the lack of rigor and scientific relevancy in coursework at the University of Minnesota.[12] Such criticism has been accused of stereotyping the social sciences as underwater basket weaving subjects.[13]\n\nDave Ramsey, American personal finance writer and radio host, has used the self-invented term \"German Polka History\" to describe university degree programs that are unlikely to result in a career and which he thus advises people against pursuing. He uses the term along with a degree in \"Left-Handed Puppetry\" as an umbrella description to avoid singling any specific degree for ridicule.[14][15]\n\nNotable uses\nSome of the boys she knew from college were trying to dodge the draft by taking graduate courses, \"underwater basket weaving and things like that,\" as Vonda contemptuously put it.\n\n\u2014\u2009Rick Atkinson, The Long Gray Line\nThis is no surprise, as normal office job functions generally require little knowledge of underwater basket-weaving, 19th century Hungarian clog art, or other things of academic interest.\n\n\u2014\u2009Jacob Lund Fisker, Early Retirement Extreme: A Philosophical and Practical Guide to Financial Independence\nThe phrase was used during the Vietnam War era to describe the sort of major that many young men who would otherwise not have entered college undertook to escape the draft.[16] US Senator Gordon L. Allott referred in 1968 to \"the situation that we were in after World War II where we had universities setting up courses in underwater basket weaving, and all this sort of thing\".[17] Senator Robert Byrd used the phrase in 1969 when questioning the use of funds to offer professional training to Cuban refugees.[18] The University of Portsmouth had a joke syllabus for underwater basket weaving on the Technology faculty pages,[19] and another joke syllabus proposal was posted by a University of Central Arkansas student magazine.[20]\n\nUS punk band NOFX referred to an underwater basket weaving course in their song \"Anarchy Camp\".[21]\n\nMoral of the story: writing \"underwater basket weaving\" will not give you an edge in the admissions process, so just be honest!\n\n\u2014\u2009MIT\nThe phrase appears in the MIT application process as a humorous example suggesting students should simply state their current interests.[22]\n\nAs a taught course\nSince 1980, Reed College in Portland, Oregon, has occasionally offered an underwater basket weaving class during Paideia, its festival of learning that offers informal, non-credit courses.[23]\n\nThe Student Resource Center at the University of Arizona offered a submerged snorkeling basket-weaving course in spring 1998.[24][25] In early 2009, a Rutgers University scuba diving instructor offered a one-off course.[26][27] Underwater Basket Weaving is a trademark of the US Scuba Center Inc.,[28] which offers a specialty class designed to improve or more fully enjoy diving skills from which participants can \"take home a memorable souvenir.\"[29]\n\nAs an April Fools joke, Coursera offered an online course on underwater basket weaving as of April 1, 2013. The class was supposed to \"consist of short lecture and demonstration videos, between 8 and 10 minutes in length, short quizzes, and practical weaving exercises.\"[30] However, the joke was seen by some as being disrespectful of indigenous cultures, and the joke designer issued an apology which was posted on the Coursera class page for \"Aboriginal Worldviews and Education.\" The apology read, in part, \"By posting the course and video, we were not intending to be disrespectful to indigenous cultures, and we sincerely apologize to anyone we offended by the content of our video.\"[31]\n\nSee also\nExtreme ironing\nGrade inflation\nJodeldiplom\nMickey Mouse degrees"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "ca2fdf6b-cba4-4b9b-962f-4e21f52a49d2", "children": ["add8cc20-1795-4f41-b3fc-9ddaec47fb03"]}, "add8cc20-1795-4f41-b3fc-9ddaec47fb03": {"id": "add8cc20-1795-4f41-b3fc-9ddaec47fb03", "message": {"id": "add8cc20-1795-4f41-b3fc-9ddaec47fb03", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1675780863.661312, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Underwater basket weaving is a term used to describe college or university courses that are perceived as useless or absurd.

We want to add more of these novel methods to our standard problem solving toolkit, but we need to understand the tradeoffs and the conflict.\n\nI argue that understanding Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and other ML technologies requires that practitioners adopt a Holistic Stance which is (at important levels) blatantly incompatible with the Reductionist Stance of modern science. As ML practitioners we have to make hard choices that seemingly contradict many of our core scientific convictions. As a result we may get the feeling something is wrong. The conflict is real and important and the seemingly counter-intuitive choices make sense only when viewed in the light of Epistemology.

And this classification excludes those sciences, like psychology, where such Model making is difficult and less often rewarded with reliable results.\n\n\nAfter considering all the advantages of Models we might wonder why we even bother discussing it. To many people, especially those with a solid STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education, it may well look like the only choice. But there is also the other strategy:\n\nHolism is the Avoidance of Models\nThis is where the questions start. This is where the paradoxes surface. This is where your worldview may get shaken up.

In this philosophy, reductionism and holism are seen as complementary, rather than opposing, approaches to problem solving.\n\nReductionism involves breaking down a complex system into smaller, simpler parts in order to understand it better. This is a common approach in traditional scientific inquiry and involves the use of models, theories, equations, and formulas to simplify and explain observations.\n\nHolism, on the other hand, is the avoidance of models and focuses on the study of the system as a whole. This approach is concerned with understanding the interconnectedness and interdependence of the parts, rather than simply their individual components.\n\nIn Dirty Word Philosophy, both reductionism and holism are seen as valuable tools in problem solving and decision making. The idea is that by combining these approaches, we can gain a more complete understanding of complex systems. This means that practitioners can choose between reductionist and holistic methods based on the specific problem they are trying to solve and how similar it is to problems seen in the past.\n\nFor example, in certain cases, a reductionist approach may be more appropriate, while in others, a holistic approach may be more suitable.

DWP is also based on this: Is 'Moral' a Dirty Word?\nMary Midgley\nPhilosophy 47 (181):206 - 228 (1972)   Copy   BIBTEX\nAbstract\nThe word moral and its derivatives are showing signs of strain. Like a small carpet, designed to fit a room which has been enlarged, they are wrenched this way and that to cover the bare spaces. Perhaps in the end we shall be forced to abandon them altogether, as Nietzsche suggested. But this would be wasteful, and it seems a good idea to examine first the various spaces they can cover, and try to fix them to the one where they are needed most. I shall approach this problem by making very full quotations. It is not an isolated verbal puzzle which can be settled by showing that a particular usage exists; we need to know as well just what it is doing. There are real muddles here, within common-sense, about the relation of thought to life. There is no simple plain-man's usage prepared for us to follow. Anyone who uses moral in anything beyond the Daily Mirror sense is no longer a quite plain man anyway, and we had better follow careful writers than casual ones, real ones than imaginary ones. Philosophers, unlike the Erewhonians, do not have to study a hypothetical language. I am sure both that quotations are necessary and that mine are inadequate; I hope other people will supplement them. As for my choice, I can only say that I have tried very hard not to be tendentious. Certainly I have quoted authors who are capable of being silly and perverse, but as far as I can see the remarks I have taken from them are sober and normal. Anyone may disagree with them, but not, I hope, think them oddly worded. My point affects all the derivatives of moral and to some extent those of ethical too, so I have drawn my illustrations from all of them."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "e5656cb4-3ca0-4016-90cc-af2793550317", "children": ["244d85ae-0a44-497b-aa9a-bc12d82ef5ff"]}, "244d85ae-0a44-497b-aa9a-bc12d82ef5ff": {"id": "244d85ae-0a44-497b-aa9a-bc12d82ef5ff", "message": {"id": "244d85ae-0a44-497b-aa9a-bc12d82ef5ff", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1675787759.726814, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Yes, the article \"Is 'Moral' a Dirty Word?\" by Mary Midgley is related to the idea of Dirty Word Philosophy (DWP) in that it examines the meaning and use of the word \"moral\" and its derivatives in language and thought. Midgley argues that the word \"moral\" and its related terms have become strained and overused, and that their meaning has become muddled in common sense. She suggests that instead of abandoning the use of these terms altogether, as Nietzsche suggested, it would be better to examine the various spaces they can cover and try to fix them to the one where they are needed most.\n\nMidgley's approach in this article is to make full quotations from various authors to understand the usage of the term \"moral\" and its derivatives. She notes that there is no simple, plain-man's usage of the term, and that careful writers, rather than casual or imaginary ones, should be followed. Midgley's choice of quotations is not intended to be tendentious, but rather to illustrate her point regarding the use of moral terms in language and thought.\n\nIn this sense, Midgley's article is relevant to DWP in that it is concerned with examining the meaning of words and concepts and the role they play in shaping our understanding of the world.

She is considered one of the first female philosophers in Western history. \nAccording to some accounts, Theano took over the running of the school after Pythagoras' death and preserved his teachings and writings, which were highly influential in the development of mathematics and philosophy in ancient Greece.\nHer own philosophical views and writings have not survived, but she is remembered as a significant figure in the history of philosophy and mathematics.\n\ud835\ude14\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude2c\ud835\ude26 \ud835\ude36\ud835\ude31 \ud835\ude22 \ud835\ude34\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude33\ud835\ude3a \ud835\ude22\ud835\ude23\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude36\ud835\ude35 \ud835\ude29\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude33 \ud835\ude22\ud835\ude2f\ud835\ude25 \ud835\ude17\ud835\ude3a\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude29\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude28\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude33\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude34 \ud835\ude29\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude37\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude2f\ud835\ude28 \ud835\ude22 \ud835\ude25\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude34\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude28\ud835\ude33\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude2e\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude2f\ud835\ude35 \ud835\ude30\ud835\ude37\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude33 \ud835\ude34\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude2e\ud835\ude26 \ud835\ude30\ud835\ude23\ud835\ude34\ud835\ude24\ud835\ude36\ud835\ude33\ud835\ude26 \ud835\ude2e\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude29\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude2e\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude24\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude2d \ud835\ude31\ud835\ude33\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude27.\nOnce upon a time, in ancient Greece, Theano and Pythagoras were well-known mathematicians and philosophers. They were married and ran a school together, teaching their students the secrets of mathematics and the wisdom of the universe.\nOne day, Theano and Pythagoras were working on a particularly challenging proof. They had been at it for days, poring over their books and scribbling equations on parchment. But no matter how hard they tried, they couldn't seem to come to a conclusion.\nThe disagreement began to strain their relationship, and they found themselves bickering and snapping at each other every time they tried to work on the proof together. Theano was frustrated with Pythagoras for his stubbornness, and Pythagoras was frustrated with Theano for not seeing things his way.\nOne day, Theano had an epiphany. She saw the solution to the proof in a dream, and she eagerly shared her discovery with Pythagoras. But to her surprise, Pythagoras was skeptical. He didn't believe that the solution was possible, and he refused to accept it.\nTheano was hurt and frustrated, but she refused to give up. She worked on the proof on her own, and after many long days and nights, she finally proved it beyond a shadow of a doubt.\nShe presented her findings to Pythagoras, and he was astounded. He finally realized that Theano had been right all along, and he apologized for doubting her.\nThe proof became famous all over Greece, and Theano and Pythagoras were hailed as geniuses. They worked together once again, teaching their students and further exploring the mysteries of mathematics.\nAnd from that day forward, they never let a disagreement come between them again. They respected each other's insights and worked together to unlock the secrets of the universe.\nThe story of Theano and Pythagoras' disagreement over the proof became a legend in Greece, and their school became famous for producing some of the greatest mathematicians and philosophers of all time.\nAnd though Theano may not have been as well-known as Pythagoras, she was remembered for her wisdom, her determination, and her ability to see the truth even when others couldn't.\n\ud835\ude1a\ud835\ude29\ud835\ude26 \ud835\ude24\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude2d\ud835\ude2d\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude25 \ud835\ude29\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude33 \ud835\ude31\ud835\ude33\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude27 \"\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude29\ud835\ude26 \ud835\ude0b\ud835\ude33\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude28\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude2f'\ud835\ude34 \ud835\ude35\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude29\" \ud835\ude31\ud835\ude33\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude27, \ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude35 \ud835\ude38\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude34 \ud835\ude2d\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude2c\ud835\ude26 \ud835\ude0d\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude23\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude2f\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude24\ud835\ude24\ud835\ude2a \ud835\ude23\ud835\ude36\ud835\ude35 \ud835\ude24\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude2f\ud835\ude24\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude33\ud835\ude2f\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude25 \ud835\ude35\ud835\ude29\ud835\ude26 \ud835\ude30\ud835\ude33\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude28\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude2f \ud835\ude30\ud835\ude27 \ud835\ude35\ud835\ude29\ud835\ude26 \ud835\ude2e\ud835\ude3a\ud835\ude33\ud835\ude2e\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude25\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude2f\ud835\ude34.\nOnce upon a time in ancient Greece, Pythagoras and his wife Theano were renowned mathematicians, revered for their contributions to the field. One day, they found themselves in a heated disagreement over a new proof that Theano had discovered.\nShe called it the \"Dragon's Tooth\" proof, a complex formula that she believed demonstrated the origin of the mythical myrmadons. Pythagoras, on the other hand, was skeptical of her findings and believed that her proof was flawed.\nDespite their differing opinions, they decided to present their arguments in front of a gathering of mathematicians, hoping to find a resolution to their disagreement.\nAs Theano explained her proof, Pythagoras listened intently, but still remained unconvinced. When it was his turn to speak, he began to present his counterargument, but was quickly interrupted by a series of gasps from the audience.\nIn the midst of their discussion, a golden dragon's tooth, similar to the one Theano used in her proof, had appeared in the room. Everyone was stunned, but Theano's eyes lit up with excitement.\n\"You see, my dear husband,\" she exclaimed. \"The proof is not only true in theory, but also in practice. The dragon's tooth is evidence of its validity.\"\nPythagoras was taken aback by this sudden turn of events, but as he examined the tooth, he began to understand the logic behind Theano's proof. He smiled and took her hand, acknowledging that she was right all along.\nFrom that day forward, Theano's \"Dragon's Tooth\" proof became known as one of the most revolutionary mathematical discoveries of their time, and she was celebrated for her brilliance and wisdom.\nPythagoras and Theano continued to work together, sharing their knowledge and pushing the boundaries of mathematical understanding.\nAnd as they looked back on their disagreement, they were grateful for the opportunity to learn from one another and for the unexpected validation that came in the form of the dragon's tooth.\n\ud835\ude14\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude2c\ud835\ude26 \ud835\ude35\ud835\ude29\ud835\ude26 \ud835\ude34\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude33\ud835\ude3a \ud835\ude2e\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude33\ud835\ude26 \ud835\ude33\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude2d\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude34\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude24, \ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude2f\ud835\ude24\ud835\ude2d\ud835\ude36\ud835\ude25\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude2f\ud835\ude28 \ud835\ude22 \ud835\ude23\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude35 \ud835\ude2e\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude33\ud835\ude26 \ud835\ude2e\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude29 \ud835\ude22\ud835\ude2f\ud835\ude25 \ud835\ude2d\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude28\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude24.\nTheano and Pythagoras had been working on a new mathematical proof for many months. The proof concerned the properties of the myrmadon sequence, a series of numbers that had been named after the mythical ant-people of ancient Greece.\nOne day, Pythagoras announced that he had finally discovered a proof that would unlock the secrets of the myrmadon sequence. Theano was skeptical, and asked to see the proof.\nPythagoras showed her his work, which relied on a series of complex calculations and logical deductions. Theano was impressed, but she soon realized that there was a flaw in Pythagoras' reasoning.\n\"You've made a mistake, my husband,\" she said. \"Your proof is missing a key step.\"\nPythagoras was taken aback. He had spent months working on this proof, and he was convinced that it was correct.\n\"What mistake?\" he asked. \"Show me where I went wrong.\"\nTheano sat down at the table and began to explain the flaw in Pythagoras' proof. She showed him how his calculations were incorrect, and how his logic was missing a crucial step.\nPythagoras listened carefully, and soon he realized that Theano was right. He had made a mistake, and his proof was indeed flawed.\n\"Thank you, my wife,\" he said. \"You have saved me from making a fool of myself in front of the entire mathematical community.\"\nTheano smiled and said, \"I am here to help you, my husband. And together, I know that we can find a proof that will unlock the secrets of the myrmadon sequence.\"\nAnd so, Theano and Pythagoras continued their work, always challenging each other and striving for a deeper understanding of the mathematical world.\nThey never gave up on their quest, and eventually, they discovered a proof that was as elegant as it was powerful. Theano named the proof \"the Dragon's Tooth\" proof, and it became one of the greatest contributions to mathematics of all time."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "a12ad2b1-0ecd-453b-9bb6-55236c82ba4e", "children": ["cf29b739-49a3-4083-a791-d2ff71487d40"]}, "cf29b739-49a3-4083-a791-d2ff71487d40": {"id": "cf29b739-49a3-4083-a791-d2ff71487d40", "message": {"id": "cf29b739-49a3-4083-a791-d2ff71487d40", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1675788564.600385, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["A tale of Theano and Pythagoras, ancient Greek philosophers and mathematicians, who were married and ran a school together.

This perspective holds that a system or phenomenon cannot be fully understood by examining its individual parts, but instead must be considered as a whole. For example, the behavior of an organism cannot be fully understood by examining its individual cells, but must be considered in terms of its entire physiology, behavior, and environment.

Finally, the keyframe_insert function is called for each sphere to insert a keyframe for the location property at the current frame."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"message_type": null, "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop": "<|im_end|>"}, "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "d61c9140-3aac-4c0e-a3d1-cba952f57d29", "children": ["678e250d-b6ee-47ed-be6b-97d876c3d6b8"]}, "678e250d-b6ee-47ed-be6b-97d876c3d6b8": {"id": "678e250d-b6ee-47ed-be6b-97d876c3d6b8", "message": {"id": "678e250d-b6ee-47ed-be6b-97d876c3d6b8", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1675631330.908755, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Merge them together."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "38a9a067-7e6b-4a2b-81f2-d426d9077919", "children": ["21641104-1f76-486f-98f2-44fd74cb4261"]}, "21641104-1f76-486f-98f2-44fd74cb4261": {"id": "21641104-1f76-486f-98f2-44fd74cb4261", "message": {"id": "21641104-1f76-486f-98f2-44fd74cb4261", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1675631402.528113, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Here's the combined code:\n\n```\nimport bpy\nimport math\n\n# Create two spheres\nbpy.ops.mesh.primitive_uv_sphere_add(size=1, location=(0,0,0))\nbpy.ops.mesh.primitive_uv_sphere_add(size=0.5, location=(10,0,0))\n\n# Get references to the two spheres\nsphere1 = bpy.data.objects[0]\nsphere2 = bpy.data.objects[1]\n\n# Define the animation length and frame rate\nframes = 100\nframe_rate = 25\n\n# Calculate the position of sphere2 at each frame\nfor i in range(frames):\n    angle = 2 * math.pi * i / frames\n    x = 10 * math.cos(angle)\n    y = 10 * math.sin(angle)\n    z = 0\n    sphere2.location = (x, y, z)\n    sphere2.keyframe_insert(data_path=\"location\", frame=frame_rate * i)\n\n# Set the animation settings\nbpy.context.scene.frame_start = 0\nbpy.context.scene.frame_end = frame_rate * frames\nbpy.context.scene.frame_current = 0\nbpy.context.scene.render.fps = frame_rate\n\n# Animate both spheres\ndef animate(sphere, angle):\n    sphere.location.x = 2 * math.cos(angle)\n    sphere.location.y = 2 * math.sin(angle)\n\nbpy.context.scene.frame_end = 360\nbpy.context.scene.frame_start = 0\nbpy.context.scene.frame_current = 0\n\nfor i in range(360):\n    bpy.context.scene.frame_set(i)\n    animate(sphere1, i * 0.01)\n    animate(sphere2, i * 0.02)\n    sphere1.keyframe_insert(data_path=\"location\", index=-1)\n    sphere2.keyframe_insert(data_path=\"location\", index=-1)\n```"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"message_type": null, "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop": "<|im_end|>"}, "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "678e250d-b6ee-47ed-be6b-97d876c3d6b8", "children": ["9a9b12bb-f3c8-41d5-96d6-ab694575ee78"]}, "9a9b12bb-f3c8-41d5-96d6-ab694575ee78": {"id": "9a9b12bb-f3c8-41d5-96d6-ab694575ee78", "message": {"id": "9a9b12bb-f3c8-41d5-96d6-ab694575ee78", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1675631445.818485, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["line 132, in __call__\n    ret = _op_call(self.idname_py(), None, kw)\nTypeError: Converting py args to operator properties: : keyword \"size\" unrecognized\nError: Python script failed, check the message in the system console\n"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "21641104-1f76-486f-98f2-44fd74cb4261", "children": ["9b03716b-e714-4851-b41d-81b7e85b0ee4"]}, "9b03716b-e714-4851-b41d-81b7e85b0ee4": {"id": "9b03716b-e714-4851-b41d-81b7e85b0ee4", "message": {"id": "9b03716b-e714-4851-b41d-81b7e85b0ee4", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1675631469.765359, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["This error message suggests that the \"size\" keyword argument is not recognized by the \"bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_uv_sphere_add\" operator.

Thus, biological principles of organization should also be the principles underlying mental operations. Practopoiesis states that the key for achieving intelligence through adaptation is an arrangement in which mechanisms laying at a lower level of organization, by their operations and interaction with the environment, enable creation of mechanisms laying at a higher level of organization. When such an organizational advance of a system occurs, it is called a traverse. A case of traverse is when plasticity mechanisms (at a lower level of organization), by their operations, create a neural network anatomy (at a higher level of organization). Another case is the actual production of behavior by that network, whereby the mechanisms of neuronal activity operate to create motor actions. Practopoietic theory explains why the adaptability of a system increases with each increase in the number of traverses. With a larger number of traverses, a system can be relatively small and yet, produce a higher degree of adaptive/intelligent behavior than a system with a lower number of traverses. The present analyses indicate that the two well-known traverses \u2013 neural plasticity and neural activity \u2013 are not sufficient to explain human mental capabilities. At least one additional traverse is needed, which is named anapoiesis for its contribution in reconstructing knowledge e.g., from long-term memory into working memory. The conclusions bear implications for brain theory, the mind\u2013body explanatory gap, and developments of artificial intelligence technologies.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nDownload : Download full-size image\n\nPrevious article in issueNext article in issue\nKeywords\nNeurophysiologyAdaptive systemsCyberneticsIntelligent behavior\n1. Introduction\nTo help solve the brain\u2013body problem (Descartes, 1983, Popper, 1999, Chalmers, 1996, Rust, 2009), systems neuroscience needs to near-decompose (Simon, 1994, Bechtel and Richardson, 1993)1 the complex biology of the brain into simple components. Likewise, biology is still in a need of a general theory of interactions that would explain relationships between its different levels of organization (Noble, 2008a, Noble, 2008b, Bateson, 2004). The present work is an attempt to develop a theory that satisfies both of these needs.\n\nThe heart of the present approach can be illustrated through the role that plasticity mechanisms play in neural networks. Be it a biological network or one simulated on a computer, without plasticity mechanisms, it would be impossible to endow the network with the structure necessary to accomplish its tasks across different environments if each environment poses different demands. Plasticity mechanisms are the means of steering the network into the desirable state of operation. Once created, the network offers another mechanism of equal steering importance: neural activity. The muscles and skeleton of a body provide machinery to generate movement and behavior. But they are useless without a network of neurons, which controls those movements. Neurons with their electro-chemical activity, and through inhibition/excitation, steer effectors and ultimately give life to the motion of the body. The present approach emphasizes that what plasticity is for a network, the network is for behavior: In both cases there is an enabling force. Both forces need to work well, and they lie in an organizational hierarchy: The rules of plasticity are organizationally lower than network anatomy, and anatomy is organizationally lower than the generated behavior. It is always that higher levels are a result of operations of lower levels and not the other way around.\n\nThe present work generalizes this lower-to-higher relationship and proposes a formal theory. This makes it possible to ask what happens if there are not only two adaptive mechanisms (plasticity and neural activity) but three (e.g., in case of an organism and its brain and mind) or four (in case of evolution operating on an entire species). Would more levels produce more intelligent behavior and how many levels are really used by biological systems?\n\nThe theory is named practopoiesis\u2014derived from Ancient Greek words \u03c0\u03c1\u1fb6\u03be\u03b9\u03c2 (praksis), meaning \u201caction, activity, practice\u201d and \u03c0\u03bf\u03af\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 (poiesis), from \u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03ad\u03c9 (poieo), \u201cto make\u201d. The term practopoiesis refers to \u201ccreation of actions\u201d, emphasizing the fact that physiological mechanisms at any level of adaptive organization operate through actions\u2014and requires mechanisms to be put in place capable of executing those actions. For example, gene expression mechanisms act, plasticity mechanisms act, and neurons act. All of those mechanisms need to be properly created. The name practopoiesis is also a tribute to the theory of autopoiesis (Maturana and Varela, 1980, Maturana and Varela, 1992), which is one of the precursors to the present work\u2014providing the insights that the process of creating new structures, or poiesis, in biological systems underlies both the physiology of an organism and its mental operations (see also Thompson, 2007).\n\nAnother theory that is a precursor to practopoiesis is self-organization (Ashby, 1947, Anrew, 1979, Szent\u00e1gothai and \u00c9rdi, 1989). Practopoiesis can be considered a specific implementation of the principles of self-organization namely those applicable to biological processes. While self-organization generally applies also to non-biological phenomena (such as galaxies or chemical reactions), practopoiesis applies exclusively to adaptive systems. This allows practopoiesis to specify more accurate the organization principles, which happen to be founded in several theorems fundamental to cybernetics (Ashby, 1956, Conant and Ashby, 1970). Being less general than self-organization practopoiesis applies only to a subset of all the processes of self-organization that take place within an organism. Practopoiesis is concerned only with those aspects that enable the organism to adapt to newly emerging circumstances in its environment. For example, retino-topic mapping between the eye and the structures in the central nervous system is established through self-organization. However, some of these processes may occur with intrinsic rhythms only, without a need for inputs from the environment (Szent\u00e1gothai and \u00c9rdi, 1989, Eglen and Gjorgjieva, 2009). Others require adaptive changes made in response to the current state of the environment (e.g., Singer and Tretter, 1976, Singer et al., 1981). Practopoiesis applies only to the latter ones. The explanatory power that practopoiesis brings to the problem of mind and brain is the suggestion proposed at the end of this manuscript stating that mental operations are by their nature adaptive. Hence, the principles of practopoiesis provide the right tools for understanding how, through self-organization of the system, the mental emerges out of physical.\n\n2. Practopoiesis: A general theory of adaptive systems\nOne of the key postulates of practopoiesis is the necessity of interactions with the environment. The idea is that each adaptive mechanism, at any level of (self-) organization, receives feedback from the environment. That way, practopoiesis follows the traditions of, and is in a general agreement with the ecological approach to mental operations (Gibson, 1977, Gibson, 1979), enactivism (Varela et al., 1991, No\u00eb, 2012), externalism (Holt, 1914, Brooks, 1991) and other works concerning situated and embodied cognition (e.g., Lakoff and Johnson, 1980, Damasio, 1999, McGann et al., 2013, Di Paolo and De Jaegher, 2012), and robotics (Brooks, 1999). Also, various preceding works considering feedback interactions (Friston, 2010, Shipp et al., 2013, Friston et al., 2012, Bernstein, 1967, Powers, 1973) provide important background for the present work.\n\nPractopoiesis can be fundamentally considered a cybernetic theory. Cybernetics studies control systems based on feedback loops (e.g. Wiener, 1961) (Fig. 1A). Practopoiesis is grounded in the theorems of cybernetics\u2014foremost, the law of requisite variety (Ashby, 1956, Beer, 1974, Beer, 1979) and the good regulator theorem (Conant and Ashby, 1970). Practopoiesis is an extension in a sense that it explains how systems obtain their cybernetic capabilities i.e., how they learn what and where to control. Hence, practopoiesis can be understood as a form of a second-order cybernetics, or cybernetics-of-cybernetics (Heylighen and Joslyn, 2001, Glanville, 2002, von Foerster, 2003)."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "7e054bd6-ef9c-44a1-8822-b3356343d9dc", "children": ["6e824580-e179-41b1-911d-c709049a323e"]}, "6e824580-e179-41b1-911d-c709049a323e": {"id": "6e824580-e179-41b1-911d-c709049a323e", "message": {"id": "6e824580-e179-41b1-911d-c709049a323e", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1675182053.33822, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Practopoiesis is a theory that proposes the principles by which adaptive systems (like biological and artificial intelligence) organize and achieve intelligence through adaptation.
